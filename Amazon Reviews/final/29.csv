1,"The photo displayed in the advertisement is quite different than the actual item. The ring itself is very small. I would classify it as a children's ring (definitely not a man's ring) or perhaps a women's ring, if she were small in stature. Look at the photo----the only black you actually see on the ring is in the side symbols. The face/head of the ring is only silver. All that detail in the photo depicted is missing on the ring because there is no black enamel highlighting. Extremely disappointed in this ring. I'm returning it immediately.",BUYER BEWARE...........

1,"I bought a nice looking watch thinking it was worth 200 bucks only to find out it was such a third rate watch. Timex are far more superior compared to this.

Their marked off prices are misleading and do not tell you the value of this watch. It's exactly the watch you would find in a flea market.

It was a present for my father in law but to find out it was a defective watch and it's embarrassing.

Guys, if you want to buy a watch, do yourself a favor: avoid this one & buy a real one.",Don't buy! It's such an embarrassment for my father in law to find out it was defective

1,These boots aren't waterproof. I wore them for 20 minutes in light rain and my socks were wet.,Not waterproof. Wet socks in 20 minutes.
1,Sizing way off. We ordered a size 7 and it is probably closer to a 5T. The length is especially wrong. Maybe 3-4 inches shorter than other size small (6-7) shirt we have.,Extremely short
1,Returned. The bracelet is not gold but rather painted a weird ivory color with a gold charm. The bracelet is also not adjustable at all and very large on small/normal size wrists.,It's not gold.
1,"I'm not sure if it's the color I bought, but these are the least flattering pants ever. They are tight from the thigh down and loose over the hips making me look 30lbs heavier.",MC Ham-hoc
1,"I was very disappointed with the fit.  I ordered it in three different sizes (sm, med and large) and none worked.  They all look fantastic in the front.  Very sexy and flattering.  I loves the ties on the side and how you could adjust the length.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Something that was sexy but also covered my butt.  I was tired of my bikini bottoms riding up so I thought this would be a good solution.  Regular skirts to me look matronly so I had high hopes for this one.  Unfortunately, the back is where is all goes wrong.  It is too tight and shows the butt crease of the liner.  Very unflattering.  I thought going up a size or two would maybe fit better but no.  I wear a size 2-4 pants, so even a large was unflattering.  I didn't try this exact product on at Athleta and it fit great and the butt looked awesome however they didn't carry it in a solid color which is what I was looking for.  So this tells me it has something to do with the design of this particular brand.",I was very disappointed with the fit
1,"So, I ordered this product under the assumption that Id be getting the top and the skirt and that the stockings were not included. All I received, however, were the stockings. I was a bit confused, to say the least. I messaged the seller but of course they never responded. That was probably a month ago. I was thinking of returning the stockings but I suppose they weren't that costly and itd be too much of a hassle. Plus, I could always use an extra set. I went ahead and bought another outfit from a different seller. Im way happier with the looks of the one I did receive and so is my fianc. At any rate, I suppose the lesson here is, always know what you're paying for and always do your research. No stars. ",I was a bit confused...
1,"This is the second Urban Oxide backpack I've had. They were both identical - both were the UO Adventure in black. the first one lasted about 10 months before the rubber loops at the bottom of the bag (the ones that hold the straps to the bag) broke. My thought was, ""Okay, I carry this nearly every day and some days it's holding a lot of stuff. I'll just use kilt pins to hold the straps on,"" In the meantime, I hemmed and hawed and looked at what seemed like a squillion backpacks before I decided to order yet another UO backpack. I liked it, liked the design and the fact that it was made from recycled material. I continued to carry to  the ""reworked"" backpack until it got so trashy that I refused to wear it anymore. I fell back on a Timbuk2 bag that I've had for years. In the meantime, I've received the new UO backpack but don't use it right away. (Ordered it in August and didn't start using it until September.) So, now I've used it maybe a month and as I'm walking through Downtown Disney, what happens? One of the damn loops breaks! Keep in mind that I've only worn this thing for a month. I love that UO uses recycled materials for their bags but I refuse to spend $70 for a backpack that breaks after a month!! And, to make this experience even worse, with Amazon's return policy, I can no longer send this back. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!! I cannot recommend this backpack in the least. Spend a little more, get something sturdy - leather, canvas, balllistic nylon - anything other than this!",UGH!!! SECOND ONE THAT HAS BROKEN!!

1,"The first pair of these shoes that I ordered fit beautifully and I fell in love with them. However on closer inspection it appeared that the shoes had been worn before. Not just tried on, but worn. There was a spot of leather rubbed off on the back of both shoes. I immediately went back on Amazon and ordered another pair because these shoes were perfect for what I needed. I didn't wait to return the first pair because I didn't want to run the risk of receiving the same pair in a second order. The second pair was in even worse condition than the first. The leather was greatly creased, they were dirty and both shoes were showing leather rubbed off in exactly the same place as the first pair. I was now in possession of two pair of these shoes, neither of which was acceptable. I returned both of them. Very disappointed, Amazon.",Used shoes

Initially I thought the quality of the leather and design were both good and was pleased with the purchase, but after wearing several times I realized the leather is too stiff and started to bend/bunch at the ankle, causing it to dig into my heel.  I should have contacted customer service right away, but this was already past their 30 day return policy mark, so thought I could just continue to wear them.  The bunching of the leather continued to worsen, and not only did the discomfort grow but eventually, the back seam near the ankle came apart. Now there is a hole in the back of the boot and it has become unwearable.  I contacted customer service - even if it has been a year I don't believe the leather seam should be coming apart for a high quality boot at this price.  However, they did not give much attention to the matter and closed the request.  I'm not too happy with either the boot or the service.

1,I had previously wrote a review on this item and rated it a 4 star due to a few flaws when I opened it. Now this review is on based on over all wearing the belt. I bought this belt for my wedding dress looked so beautiful I only had it on for maybe 30 mins when it started to fall apart. I wore it on my dress for the ceremony and right after for pictures it just would not hold up the glue that they put on it to attach to the ribbon started to weaken and it was just hanging off the ribbon. I was taking pictures at this time and was so embarrassed I had to only take pictures on one side so it wouldn't show and my groom had to hold it on while we were standing around it was awful ruined my whole pictures. I had to then just take it off my dress and not wear it for the rest of the night. My dress was plain silk and I needed this belt for extra bling and was sad when I had to take it off my dress that night due to it just falling apart and I tried pinning it still wouldn't work. I would not buy this item or if you do have it sew on the dress. Im very disappointed specially for the money I spent on it. I could just cry I was so sad. So now some of my wedding pictures for sunset don't have this belt on my dress and I look plain jane. :(,Four Stars

So I took the jop and finally purchased the bag. I was over joyed waiting for it to arrive. Well first the packaging bent the wings so they were all curled in and looked more like a sad droopy set of ears. I figured meh, I can get it to smooth right out and stiffen up with no problem... Well so I went to use it... the FIRST attempt to wear the bag, with NOTHING in the bag. Was even careful to loosen the straps first to really make sure I didn't have the same problem... and well... It happened, I felt the annoying pop and tear... Hoping it was my imagination I took the bag off looked at it and yup... the bag ripped right where the stitching was on the bag. There was no supposed for where it was attached so it was probably an inevitable tear, but after the first TRY to wear... not acceptable. I sent it back and got a full refund.

The design of this bag is that the strap can only be on your right shoulder. When you swing the bag to open the main compartments, the zippers are facing the ground so you cannot access anything in the two main compartments! This is the exact opposite of the smaller bell shaped version which I had. Therefore the only zipper you can open is the umbrella or water bottle compartment. This is extremely inconvenient and is a terrible design. You cannot put the strap over your left shoulder as the bag won't seat properly on your back that way. It seems victorinox designed this with zero thoughts to how people use it. The only way to access the main compartments is to take the entire bag off.

1,"I'm a size 16 but have fairly huge boobs (38 F). I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea. I guess because the price was so low and the dress was so cute I thought I'd give it a go. I ordered the largest size there was-xxl.  So...I got it yesterday. It's super cute. I pulled it on and struggled to get the under slip-thingie down. I'll have to look at it again when I have more time because the problems I found with this dress are a) WAY to snug in the bust. Turned my cleavage into a uniboob. b) the skirt is flowy and sheer, and with dresses like this, there's usually a dark slip like skirt underneath. There was one such skirt, but it only came down half-butt. I thought to myself, ""that's just not right"" and struggled to pull it over my head again. When I get home and can look at it more closely I'll advise whether or not the slip is long enough.

I gave it a 3 because the dress itself is cute...but if you're a busty girl (REALLY BUSTY), this may not be your cup of tea. The rest of the fit seemed fine. I'm 5'3"" and it came almost to my ankles, by the way.

Post scriptum:
Ok. I don't know if this is a flaw or what but the under slip part of the dress doesn't even cover my backside, so if I wear this I better plan for some funky leggings or something. I thought when I first tried it on maybe my uniboob was pulling at the slip and causing it to ride up-but that's not the case. The underslip is just not entirely there. Maybe this was just my bad luck. Sigh. This dress was a joke.",holy uniboob!

1,"I love watches and would like to say I'm a watch collector and enthusiast in the beginning stages. I own a tungsten watch, however it's not coated and shines brilliantly silver/platinum like shine. I've been searching for a black coated tungsten watch for a few months already, and when I saw this one it was EXACTLY what I was looking for. I hardly ever take chances on low priced Asian products but I just had to on this one, the only reason why I tried it was because it was backed by amazon prime. However, to my demise and disappointment, it was too good to be true. I was hoping that it wasn't 60 bucks original price, but they dropped it from the advertised 160 to get people to buy their watch, and was of 160 dollar quality. Since there weren't any legit reviews I decided to take a shot and see for myself, couldn't let up such a good deal!
REVIEW:
The watch face itself looks great, at first glance the whole watch looks good. The hands were functioning just fine no anomalies apparent. Upon closer inspection you can notice the inferior quality, particularly in the links. The links feel flimsily put together, not firm by any means. The clasp is also feels very flimsy. The package included a link remover, the instructions were all in Chinese like writing, the intro to the manual was in English but the actual instructions, uselessly weren't. I've removed links from watches before, this one didn't have tiny arrows to indicate the direction you're supposed to push out the link and the manual was useless on the matter. Took a wild shot, attempted to remove a link from the side which the crown sits, and the link completely chipped and broke, I used a small hammer and was lightly tapping it, even with that, the link broke. (the wristband is ceramic, not tungsten at all) . Seeing I probably came in the wrong direction, the next link I did the other way and the same thing happened. I decided to stop and call it quits with this watch.

If this seems too good to be true, its because it is. Take my word for it and spend a little more money on a trusted brand. Never going to take a gamble with shady foreign goods, with even shadier descriptions. I honestly feel robbed, I will attempt to return it to amazon under these conditions.

*Update* Amazon didn't hassle me at all over the return, and was returned the 60 dollars in full and promptly as well. That's why I do prime purchases only!",It's too good to be true

The right ankle strap kept stretching to the point where it no longer fit and my foot just flopped around. This caused for some serious friction and nasty blisters. (This is after i wore the shoes around my apartment a couple times). I got through the day by covering every possible inch of skin in Band-Aids. So I thought, this is a fluke. These shoes are great quality. So I ordered a replacement pair. Just received them today and put them on, took 5 steps and behold, the left ankle strap is now so stretched out, the tightest buckle hole lines up with the loosest hole on the other shoe.

1,"I have purchased many jumpsuits like this one and I always order a 3x in order to get a loose, carefree look. To my surprise, the fit on this jumpsuit is the worse, which is odd because the sewing is gorgeous but the cut and measurements of garment is critically off regardless of what sizing chart is utilized. Im a curvy woman (57, 38 waist, 48 hip and 200 lbs) I usually can fit in a U.S. size 16, which will fit close to my curves and a U.S. size 18, which is a little loose and extremely comfortable for me. Sadly, when I put the jumpsuit on, even after loosening the straps, the jumpsuit came up to my knees. Although it had a loose fit around the waist and hip area, the breast area was a bit restricting. To add insult to injury, you can see the logo red dye peer through the back top of the ivory/white jumpsuit, which automatically ruins the garment. The only way this jumpsuit can reach my ankles is if I wear the entire jumpsuit as pants . If the straps were a little longer the outfit may fit longer and maybe even improve the fit in the chest area. The material is light and airy and I loved the hue of the jumpsuit. If you do buy the ivory/white it is a bit sheer so proper undergarments is essential if you are conservative. However if you are using the jumpsuit as a beach cover up you will have no worries.  The shipping and packaging of the product is one of the best I have seen and it was quick. I hate that I have to rate this as a 1 but it is a fair assessment when I compare this product to similar products I have purchased from Amazon. Here is a photo of the red M and logo peering through the garment, the sheerness of material when light hits, the inside of the logo tag sewn inside of the garment, the m red shading of logo peering through without direct light, and strap lengths at its shortest and longest. I am choosing not to return the item and may wear the jumpsuit as pants or attempt to replace the straps and dye the jumpsuit so that the logo ink cannot be seen. I would remove the logo but it will do little for the ink transfer.",If you are over 54 do not buy

1,"I've only had the watch for about ten days, so I can make no claims about its long-term reliability, but it's an attractive, interesting watch at a low price.  Like most manual-wind watches, you need to wind it off and on during the day, kind of like feeding a pet, while avoiding over-winding and breaking the mechanism;  just stop winding as soon as you feel any resistance.

If you wind it in the evening, I've found it keeps accurate time overnight - I haven't had to reset it for about a week now.  Like most watches with exposed innards, it can be a bit difficult to read at times, but ease-of-use probably isn't why you bought this item in the first place.

1,"Very Disappointed.

1. I bought this and after only 2 trips, one of the zipper pulls fell off (many people having this issue).  The pull is attached to the zipper through a small metal loop that is only partially closed that further opens over time, allowing the zipper pull to fall off and get lost.  All the zippers will likely have the same fate.  All they had to do was fully close the loop so the zipper pulls don't fall off.  Not rocket science.

2. And while they offer a 'repair shop locator' on their website, there is not a repair shop with 200 miles of Boston!  Not 1.  Are you kidding me?!?

So I have to pay $$$ to ship a practically new suitcase to a repair facility to replace the zipper pull so I can open my suitcase.???

I have a heck of a time finding jeans that are long enough and I refuse to wear short jeans (I don't want to look like a dork with my socks showing!).  The biggest flaw some of these have, which is all but ONE pair that I own, is that the ones that have the light colored, extremely flimsy, front pocket lining material rip out.  The insides of all of the front pockets, that have this crappy material, tear out.  Now, since there isn't any substantial material left in those pockets, the top part of the pocket (that is made out of denim) won't stay tucked down.  It has nothing to hold it down.  Not to mention that the pockets are completely useless for keeping money in.  I seldom carry a purse and rely on having pockets that aren't blown out or full of holes for carrying cash.  I have one pair of Cowgirl Tuff jeans that have a black material that lines the front pockets and haven't had any problems with that material blowing out or getting full of holes AND it keeps the upper part of the pocket tucked in.",The jeans are great but the pocket lining material is awful!

There is no give, like with leather that will stretch a bit. I am not going to keep a wallet that is this expensive and does not stay shut. Back to the seller it goes.",Doesn't stay shut.

1,Too small very dissatisfied,Not happy
1,"Disappointing! I understand that it wasn't meant to be fancy and you get what you pay for, but this wasn't worth anything.

The first major let down was when I opened it. COVERED in hot glue. Glue strings between areas they glued. Not one or two but a spider web. Those are easy to remove but there was too much glue in many spaces and I was afraid to pull it off because the fabric would come off with it. The fabric covering was clumsily cut. There were areas not trimmed and some with blade cuts where they missed.

I had read reviews that it was flimsy. Yes it was, but that was manageable. It comes in pieces; 3 bars, 2 sides and the bottom. This is probably a good thing because I imagine if it were assembled it would be as haphazardly done as well. it took effort to not be crooked. I did like the option to take a bar out and be able to set things on the base.

Overall this could be a nice item is it was constructed with care. I returned it immediately. I wish I had taken pictures to show you, but I feel I described it well. I will stay away from this vendor and maker.

I hope this review helps. If so, please click below.",It's like they didn't even care

My fourth issue was that one of the sleeves on the dress had a red tint to it. On the other hand the dress was cheap so I guess my expectations were a little too much for the price.

And if you leave them be...well let's just say that I wouldn't every wear a skirt with these. I was extremely disappointed. The quality surprised me as well. The material was thin, the waist-band was very narrow, and in places the elastic was showing through the seams, so that it touched my skin and rubbed.

1,"I was excited to obtain this bracelet at an affordable price.  It was on sale, etc. so it cost me around $9.  I wrapped it around my wrist and immediately the problem was obvious: because there is only one stud to attach the bracelet, once the bracelet is snapped into place,  there is a floppy ""tail"" left over with no way to make it stay down. The look is sloppy and unkempt.  The single stud is able to be unscrewed, but still, no matter where you put it, the remaining part of the bracelet is all askew.  What this bracelet needs is a second stud to put into one of the other holes to make the remaining tail stay down. Maybe I have this problem because my wrist is smallish, but I think a second stud would solve the problem and immediately make it able for all wrists to enjoy easily.  Now, I get to be a bracelet repair girl and go to Joann Fabric's jewelry making aisle or wherever and see if I can fix this thing.  In the meantime, it's off my wrist.",Cheap looking

When it arrived, two other people were there and one, who is a small petite 5' 1"" girl, tried it on and it was VERY snug on her. We all had a good laugh over the sizing and label.

However, the extra large was pretty tight, I was surprised. I was glad they sent the wrong size.

The main problem with this sweater, which is what I've heard about some other sweaters by this company, is the neck is way to big.
The neck is not round either, it is more football shaped  (U.S. football).

It's too  bad , I liked the material. It is see through which I don't mind, I always wear a tshirt under my sweaters.
It is cream color so a white tshirt won't look that great at the same time, black does not either considering it's somewhat see through so , would have to find a tshirt that matched. (matter of opinion I know)

Pro: Nice waffle texture material.

Also, the front is MUCH SHORTER (about 12 inches, a significant amount) than the back. It barely reaches my hips in front, while the back reaches past my butt. It's so cute, I just wish they would have cut it properly so it would drape properly over my arms and down the front.

2,"I purched my luggage September 13, 2015. It was delivered on time. I opened  the box and thought wow this is a beautiful set.  I can't wait to use it. I opened the suitcases and there's a horrid chemical smell. I put skunkie pouches inside for a month to get rid of the odor. I finally used the cases for the first time October 29 thru November 2, 2015. When I picked up my luggage at baggage claim, I was shocked to see my case peeling. The case was actually peeling on the front and back. One foot fell off and the inside screws for the wheels  popped off which caused one of the wheels came off. I had to borrow a Philips Head  to screw the wheels back on and hoped they'd hold until I finished my vacation. I am very disappointed because $199.00 is a lot of money to be wasted on cheaply made product. I would love for them to be replaced or get a refund.

2,"Almost a really good boot for the price. It's comfortable enough to wear all day, and it feels like there is enough protection in the heel, toe area, and ankles if you ever got into a minor accident. They seem airtight and waterproof to a minor extent. Also they are super easy to get in and out of. Unfortunately the downfall is on the latch. On the shoes I received the latches don't work. The second I put any strain on them they pop open. So many a times I would be walking around and the strap would be dangling around and even though they're new, I felt kinda ghetto with these busted straps. Also if they aren't latched properly while I'm riding and I get into an accident at 60 mph, the only thing keeping these on my feet are Velcro... So yeah I'm not too confident that they would even stay on considering how easy they are to slip on. I cannot recommend these boots to anyone due to the fact that I would not want to be wearing these boots in any accident. There's no point in wearing protection if it's just going to come off when you need them most.

Also, one of the the belt-end keeper parts (there are two loops attached to each for holding the end in place when buckled) came unstapled and fell off upon taking the harness out of the bag. So, do NOT get if your underbust and rib cage area below that are greater than 33 inches, as it cannot be altered to fit anyone much larger, and expect to reinforce all the buckles and pieces with stitching or something as it will fall apart.

So I've had my pair for a few months now, and I am lowering my rating because every time I have worn my Trusox in a match I have gotten blisters where the rectangular pads are under the ball of my feet.  I have gone back to just wearing normal football/soccer socks.  Talking to others that wear Trusox I appear to be a rare case not liking them.

Sadly, I can't return them at this point, though they are in great shape.  First, though they run a little small in length (I'm usually a 9.5, but had to get a 10 in these), they are very wide.  The material where the logo is would bunch up when I'd walk in them.  It looks terrible, but it wasn't a dealbreaker for me.  I really wanted to like the shoes because they were so highly recommended.  Plus, I loved the colors, needed the shoes, and didn't have time to look for others.  Well, it took me about 6 weeks to realize that they were making my feet hurt horribly (I first just thought it was age-related or maybe I changed the way I was doing something...anything but the shoes!).  I have worn minimalist shoes for years without any pain, but these just made the bottoms of my feet hurt.  Apparently, the sesamoid bones on the bottoms of my feet were smashed to smithereens sometime more than 20 years ago (when I found out about it).  That's when I saw a podiatrist about an unrelated problem, and he said, ""I don't know how you can walk without unbearable pain"" because of the smashed bones.  Well, these are the first shoes I have owned that made me aware of those obliterated bones.  I finally broke down and bought some new Nikes the other day.  My feet instantly felt better when I put them on.  I wore them this morning to work out for the first time, and I didn't give my feet a second thought.",Doesn't live up to the hype

2,"So wanted to keep this bag. I ordered a cheaper one to see which i preferred more. For starters this bag was beautiful right out of the box. Once I started inspecting it and holding it I couldn't believe the weight of it when there wasn't anything in it. The material was nice and the fringe was just what I was looking for. Loved the option to use it as a backpack or carry as a shoulder purse. Once I tried it on as a backpack and noticed there was no way to tighten the bag to fit closer to my body for hands free I realized it wouldn't work as I was looking for a hands free backpack purse that felt comfortable carrying. No fancy interior inside. There are gold clips that clip everything together. The second worst part were the tassels at the end of the drawstring. They were huge weights (beads)and I mean pretty oddly large ones at the ends of the drawstring tassels that weighed the bag down significantly. Granted, it does have a snap on the inside once you use the drawstring but the bag itself would hang to the ground because of the much added weight. I felt like it wasn't functional enough to keep which really bummed me because it was what I had really wanted. The fringe and material beautiful but like I said no pretty lining and way too heavy a bag. Very disappointed. Needles to say, I went with the cheaper purse that way much more functional and affordable.","Wasn't functional for me, way too heavy"

The booklet/manual explains that to use this product and program/adjust features, you need to download the app. So basically if you have a cell phone that is a year or so old, it's likely that your cell will say the phone ""isn't compatible"" with the app and will not allow you to download. I realize that this was probably explained in the description of the watch, or maybe that detail should be obvious or common knowledge (the need for newer cell/android/apple device), and I'm just too ""un-tech-savvy""....but it is still a disappointment. Does everyone buy new devices so you can have new/utd OS, because I sure don't and I'd imagine I'm not the only one. So my main disappointment is 1) must have latest apple/android devices that will allow this app to be downloaded, or is ""compatible"" for use of the app.  2) I would be stoked about the product if they could only allow you to make adjustments, update details/progress/logging of results.....on other devices or systems that aren't brand new or have latest OS s on them....., like your desktop or directly through their website?? It just disappoints because it keeps the folks who don't have the latest devices (cells/tablets and kindles) from being able to use or manage this device in any way. I'm going to need to return it and look into other watches/trackers that allow users who have cell phones/tablets bought a year or so ago...or those folks who might only have a PC (seniors perhaps?) to use the watch, even if you aren't able to sync your figures/results, or store longer than a few days....yet have the ability to use the device and program the needed info onto it...like date/time and the person's details/goals etc would be....without having to additionally own the latest devices or access to the app. :(  :(",Disappointed.

I think this is more of just a fashion sneaker than for athletics.  If you want good arch support, stick with the Saucony Original.  This shoe doesn't have it.

2,"This comes with 12 sets of bracelets and of the two sets I've opened so far, both were missing beads. It comes with two types of silver spacer beads.  It's supposed to have 12 of each type but the first one I opened only had 8 or 9.  I had to open up another set to finish the first bracelet, and since that set was also already short on the same beads, that one will need even more beads from another set to finish. By the time I'm finished I will probably only have about 8 bracelets.  It does come with a small bag of extra beads but it's only enough to make up for the missing beads in one bracelet!  Also beware that the bracelets are a bit small. I have a normal sized wrists and it fits tightly on me.  I'd prefer it a little looser but can't make it bigger because there aren't enough beads.
One positive:  the beads are very pretty and makes a nice looking bracelet.",Missing beads!

I don't usually use the speed laces on the upper portion of the boots and good thing.  These would certainly not be long enough.  They are barely long enough to just lace the eyelet portion.  That being said, it's my fault for ordering laces that are too short.  Not RW fault.  What is their fault is the durability.  Every set of these laces I've had have been LUCKY to see six months.  They are relatively fragile and abrade quickly where they rub the eyelets and will break if you pull too hard on them (which is not very hard.)

Sasquatch riding the Loch Ness monster is manufactured by Next Level Apparel, Great White vs Bear is by Ames Bros, and Sasquatch Wrestling a Unicorn doesn't say.  They are all soft shirts, which I like, but the Sasquatch Unicorn shirt is boxier, is cut shorter at the bottom, and has a  much wider neck opening.  I don't like this fit/style at all.  I like the Ames Bros manufactured fit the best.  If there was consistency in fit, I would definitely buy more.",Not a consistent fit from shirt to shirt

2,"...I was looking for a Mephisto shoe that I could wear for soft court tennis that would not irritate my achilles tendons (which happens with certain Prince tennis shoes and SAS walking shoes) and thought that this style would work.  I was wrong.  Although the fit was generally as expected, the heel cup was wide and my heel kept slipping up and down no matter how I laced the shoes.

I have three older pair of Mephisto shoes that I love (a pair of leather walking shoes, a pair of leather sandals, and a pair of cloth Allrounders).  The most important quality about all three is that the heel cup fits and holds my foot in place without irritating my achilles tendons.","What I like about Mephisto shoes is the quality and comfort, however..."

Style screams 80s to me... don't you think? ;) If you are a larger woman, I do not think this would be a flattering style on you... only if you have a skinny waist to show off. Otherwise, it emphasizes the tummy with the heavily stretched waist.","Ordered 1 size too large, and too small still"

2,"Nothing is really right with this jumpsuit.
The moment I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was how incredibly cheap the fabric felt. According to the label, it is made of 100% polyester, and it feels thin and plastic-y. The sound the fabric makes when it moves is not entirely dissimilar to that of one of those swishy, rainproof windbreakers, only quieter. Then, I tried to put it on. I found the straps unnecessarily difficult to get over my head, and I was afraid I might accidentally tear a strap or something in the process. Finally, once I managed to get it on and take a look in the mirror, it honestly just wasn't very flattering. The top half is fine, but the hips and legs made me look frumpy and wide. Maybe it would be alright on another body type, probably on somebody with proportionately thicker thighs.
It's gonna have to go back. I might recommend it if it were closer to $40 but this is honestly just a ripoff. I can't believe anybody could sell this for $180 with a clear conscience.",Bad.

First of all, this swimsuit is SUPER cute, and would have been awesome for a second trimester suit for me.  The shape was adorable, and everywhere fit great EXCEPT that the top was too short, so it didn't meet the top of the bottoms, which was...not flattering.  It looked like I was trying to squeeze into something too small.  Like I said, everywhere else fit great (not too tight or anything), so going up a size wouldn't have helped, and I just returned it.

These things I don't really mind or care about too much, but what really peeved me was the shirt's design. The print is really small compared to the shirt, and this leads to a really awkward looking proportion. You have a big blue shirt with a tiny little square that barely reads ""La Dispute"". Personally, I don't wear band shirts for its 'fashion statement', I prefer to wear shirts because I enjoy the band and like the design, so to me it's important that the shirt has what it's intended to have; as opposed to just being another shirt I wear. The color I can overlook, the smell I can wash out, but the design I at least want to be fairly proportional to what's presented in the product photo.

Conclusion, it's big, blue, and smells weird. However, worst of all, the design is microscopic compared to the product image and the shirt itself.","Fairly disappointing; small design, different blue, and reaks of a Chernobyl disaster."

The pants fit perfectly and look comfortable, BUT one leg seam was poorly sewn and that pant leg has a hole.  Not a benefit for a cold weather item!  Being spring and needing warm clothing makes it impossible to shop in stores.  But not on Amazon!  I was surprised to find so many options - including this adorable outfit - and many items at off-season pricing.  I'm not much of a complainer or returner, so I didn't contact the seller nor did I return the item.  My grand daughter only wore this once.  Not sure it's even worth donating to Good Will.

It's been two weeks wearing these boots everyday and I had to replace the Danner inserts, not because they failed but because the factory inserts are very thin and my feet were killing me after standing around in them all day. After trying five or six different inserts, I purchased a pair of expensive gel ones which seemed comfortable and I thought would help.

The coat with liner was really warm, and even in the middle of Wisconsin winter, I decided to take out the liner, which was buttoned in and time-consuming to remove. The outer shell initially seemed smooth and neat, but it is sooo polyester that putting it on lead to a huge static buildup, even though my shirt and pants were all cotton. The static was so bad that the coat would not drape right. It bunched up in weird places and made it look deformed.

2,"I bought this watch elsewhere and REALLY wanted to love it. I've been searching for a classy looking analog/digital watch and thought I'd finally found a keeper. Unfortunately, as is mentioned in another review, the digital part is far too dark to be of any use except in total darkness with the backlight engaged. If I hold the watch at just the right angle in bright sunlight I can mostly discern what the digital portion is showing, but in any other lighting condition that display is totally unreadable. It's so dark that sitting here in my office in bright indoor light, I can't tell what that display is showing whether I press the backlight or not. I can only see it if I cup my hands around the watch and then press the backlight again. The rest of the watch is beautiful. I love the blue face, the hefty construction, the classy bracelet band, the locking crown, the rotating bezel, the luminescent hands and markers and a few other things about it. However, since the main thing I was looking for was a functional digital capability IN ADDITION to all of those great attributes, this watch simply fails as a dual-purpose piece. If all I wanted was an elegant purely analog watch at a great price, several other SO&CO models would do nicely. This one needs a complete redesign of the contrast ratio for the digital portion to truly be what it claims to be.",Useless Digital Display

I cant even get it past  my bottoms leave alone buttoning. I guess if I order a 34 or 36 it would be fine :) I know some skinny jeans can be very tight on your thighs, but to wear this i guess some one should be stick thin.

2,Disappointed swimsuit is not anywhere close to what is pictured. I have contacted seller on several different occasions with zero results. Apparently when posting photos and typing in color the pictures were mixed matched. I will be returning. I've learned a valuable lesson by not buying Prime items.

2,"This is a beautiful case. I had it on my phone for several months. It was very slim and lightweight. However, it was a very tight fit. I do think this is my fault because I have a nervous tick of taking my cases on and off, but it caused the screen on my phone to pull away from the back. I had to go get the screen replaced.

2,So I gave this shirt 2 stars because my daughter can still wear the shirt but both the two side ties came off as my daughter was actually trying on the shirt for the first time.  Since she had to have it for the next day at school I was forced to keep it but just know the ties come off easily and are fake.,Fake ties that fall off
2,"The embroidery on the front is nice and I like the fabric.

The top really goes for this new ""show everyone your bra...a lot"" trend that seems to be the thing these days.  It's ""so over"" being a tank top that it's not even a tank top anymore, it's just a fabric sling that waves back and forth in front of your bra.

But then again, who really NEEDS to wear a bra anymore?  Maybe I'm just too bourgeois, maybe I suffer from a lack of imagination, maybe I ought to throw caution to the wind and let my two spaniel's ears fly.  Then I would only have to worry about copious side-boob instead of giving the neighborhood an eye full of my summer sweat stained side-bra.","Le Side-Bra, Le Chic!"

2,The material feels cheap and it is super small. May be a good starter purse for a pre-teen or young teenager.,Not what I expect from Coach
2,"I was shocked that I followed the size guide exactly and these were so incredibly too small. They may be great a size or two up, but they certainly did not fit as expected! I don't care about sizes and numbers, so don't buy based on ""vanity sizing"" but rather, based on the size that I think will fit my frame. Oh well. I found some other cute white capri jeans that fit perfectly (and were a good deal less expensive).",Way smaller than expected
2,"It *should* have been amazing.  The fabric is heavy and thick, and very forgiving.  I wanted to love it.  However, there are several problems with the dress I received.

One, the ombre is messed up.  The photo clearly shows lighter strips on top of the bust.  My dress did not have that which made the bust look very plain and put way too much emphasis on the bottom of the skirt, where the lighter strips were.  It made the whole dress unbalanced.

Two, speaking of the bottom of the skirt, the bottom four bandage strips have the ombre in the wrong order.  This is a subtle thing but it makes a big difference to the overall look.

Three, their product photo is photoshopped within an inch of its life because there is NO WAY that black midsection is that tall.  I stretched the dress (gently) to try to get it even close to the picture and no... it's just photoshop.  Lame.

The fourth issue is the sewing at the neckline.  The dress I received has a pucker in it that is impossible to hide no matter how artfully you tug the neckline to try to smooth it out.

I am giving it two stars for the material and concept but it's going back.  I am tempted to re-order it in case it was a fluke with the dress I received.  If I do receive a better product, I'll update this review.

I am 5'6"" and 120lb and ordered a size M.  It fit well; the sizing was accurate.

Update: The second dress I received had both of the same issues.  Disappointing.  The picture of the second dress is the one of it lying flat.  The other two grey dress photos are of the first dress.

HOWEVER -- the dress in the pink color is gorgeous.  The ombre is balanced and it is a darker pink than in the picture.  It's really quite pretty.  It doesn't exactly work with my skin tone, but I'm keeping it just because it's so pretty.","Grey has weird ombre, pucker at neckline."
2,"Because of rounded toe, these shoes run a size smaller!!",Run small
2,"I consider this brand an investment. I had it hem this dress which I didn't mind, but when I washed it to remove the fabric marker, all of the black bled into the white and it looks like mold or something. It is ruined and I haven't even worn it yet. Really sad.",It bleeds when you wash it. Even on cold.
2,"This is an absolutely beautiful handbag!  It is very large and roomy. You can fit a laptop in this bag.  Looks like it would be a great bag to travel with!  Unfortunately, the one that I received was a defected product because one of the rivets were already broken off the front handle.  I purchased Frye due to their quality and craftsmanship.  I have other Frye handbags and boots as well that have held up great over the course of many years.  To pay this much $ and receive a defective product was very disappointing.  Luckily Amazon was great about allowing me to return the item and they sent out a replacement handbag immediately.  Unfortunately though, the second Amy Shopper Bag also had a broken off rivet when I opened up the box, so it went back as well and am awaiting refund.  Very disappointed, as I've had my eye on this handbag for a long time and finally splurged.  Will just have to keep looking for a high-quality, large leather tote!!!",Defective Broken Off Rivets...

2,The sweater is soft and beautiful but very disappointing on the size. I purposely ordered an XL even though I'm more like a L allowing room for wearing a long sleeve shirt underneath. XL fit more like a medium and was not at all an XL so I must return it.,Beware: XL means medium

Even when I wash it the material is scratchy and the sleeves are short like in the photo. The zipper feature is so cute and sexy so that's why I purchased it but the quality of the shirt throws it off. I won't wear it at work and plan to sell it at a garage sale or give it away.

It's not my cup of tea. For the price, you really get what you pay for.  I purchased a size XL and usually wear a Small or Medium shirt. It fit perfect but again, I wouldn't wear it because it isn't as nice as the photo. It is an off pink, not this warm pink color.","Off Color, So sheer, Not worth the buy for me. Beware"

2,"I was looking for a lightweight boot that would keep my feet warm during the winter months for s variety of activities.  after researching online about the various types of insulation and how they perform under different conditions, I decided to give these boots a try based on their cold weather rating and the price of the boot. When I got the boots I tried them on and noticed they were a little snug. I figured I would be able to break them in after a little use as I do with all of my footwear so I didn't think this would be a problem.
The first sizable snowstorm came at the end of January along with cold temperatures. I put these boots on and went outside  I'm not sure of the exact temperature for that day but it was somewhere around 20 degrees. I wasn't worried though because these boots had a temperature rating of up to -50 degrees below zero and the 600 grams of Thermolite.  After about 35 minutes of using my snow blower and doing a small amount of shoveling my toes began to get cold. It got so bad that I had top go back inside for a while to warm my feet up. An extra layer of socks seemed to help a little but my toes still got cold.
The boot performed reasonably well under cold conditions while walking but I would recommend ordering at least a half size up from your normal size.

2,"This is a good looking coat, but I have several issues with it.

First, the hood is a joke and more or less useless. Allow me to elaborate. The coat itself is fairly snug in the neck if you button it all the way up. I'm 6'4 and have a 17.5 inch neck. The hood is meant to button over the collar, but the hood is at least three inches shorter than the collar of the coat. This means that you would have to be REALLY skinny in order for the hood to work. Basically, if you had a 14.5 or 15 inch neck, but were somehow wearing an XLT coat, it might work. The hood is removable via zipper. I suspect they include the same hood for all coat sizes. That would explain why the hood is clearly too small for the XLT coat I ordered.

Second, the title is PARKA, but this is at best a mid-weight coat. It is long like a parka, but not really suitable for colder weather. Anything less that 32F, and you would likely find the coat not warm enough.

I ordered an XLT, but I feel the coat could be a bit roomier in the chest to allow layering under the coat, especially since the coat isn't likely to be adequate for colder weather. The sleeves seemed very slightly shorter than I would expect for an XLT.

The overall construction quality seems adequate, but not particularly robust. Fairly lightweight zippers, especially for the liner. Fairly lightweight stitching. Although I wouldn't expect this coat to be heavy duty since it does have a moderately upscale look to it, I wouldn't expect it to hold up well over time.

I'll probably be returning mine.",Unimpressive

In a nutshell:
 - AWESOME ONESIE!!
 - I'm 5'2, >100lb
 - Perfect fit when pulled all the way down while standing up, but rises up when laying/lounging around
 - Looks cute in that cropped way tho
 - I could live in this...wait...I already have lived in it all weekend when sick at home playing video games with my boyfriend!

Cons:
 - Not like pictured for the hood part (looks awkward and just straight up awful)
 - Sheds like a real big cat
 - Arm and leg bands rise up so you have to keep pulling it down (so size up if you want the lengths longer, or stay true to size for the cute cropped fit)

Pros:
 - SUPER plush and soft
 - SUPER Cute
 - Has a zipper opening in the back so you don't need to take off everything to go use the bathoom
 - You'll wish you can live in it too

I wanted to return this onesie because the white mouth part of the hood was wayyyyy too long and just looks awful. Like..WTF IS THAT?!?!?! Is that supposed to be a tiger's mouth or a plush replica of a giant tooth stuck underneath 2 black beady eyes?!?! But regardless, I kept it because (1) returning is a hassle, (2) I was sick, and (3) it was too soft to return and I wanted to live in it all weekend while I played Resident Evil 2 with my Giraffe partner-in-crime. Speaking of... I bought the giraffe version (size XL for my 6'3"" bf) and it fit him the same way the Small fit on me: A bit cropped where it hits your ankles and wrists at a slightly shorter length, but still cute in its fit. We both lived in it all weekend and it was awesome. But this kitty left her yellow fur shedded everywhere in the apt.

Overall, BEWARE of the tiger one. *see this review's photo reference*
The giraffe one, however, is nice & didn't shed as much. Maybe I just received a faulty one... Either way...Major points knocked off cuz of the stupid mouth part that makes the entire onesie look....stupid -___-","Not as pictured, but soft & plush AF"

The fabric is cotton and these are not see through at all so that's nice... But regardless of the great fit and the fabric choice being thick enough to not show skin one bug downfall is the sewing/construction of the leggings which has led to a blown out crotch area of the leggings as well as some random smallish eraser head size holes on the front of the pants which all came about after just around 2months of owning them out of nowhere. I didn't wear them tons of times and always wash items the way they say to wash them so I don't know why they just started falling apart... And I must state that this was not an isolated situation with this one pair in this style... As I purchased a pair in this style in person at a store that sells Jockey a little less than a month ago to see if that was an isolated problem with this pair I ordered on here. Well that pair in this style from my local store is already getting holes as well so I'm for sure bummed out as I feel like I just gave my money away for free as I can't even wear this pair I ordered on here unless I sew and sew each hole as they keep reopening like they have been doing. I don't have the price tag/sales tag thingie that come attached as I removed them when I received them in the mail, well after I had tried the leggings on in order to make sure the fit was good... So I guess I'm just at a total loss which upsets me as I had high hopes that thiss style of Jockey Leggings would be a great and worthwhile purchase as I always remembered Jockey to have nice workout/casual clothing. Now I am not so sure I would purchase Jockey leggings on Amazon or the local stores that sell them unless I had an opportunity to try out something that didn't fall apart within the first 1-3months of wearing. I hope this review helps anyone wondering about construction and quality and again I just wish this could of gone a different way as I normally live Jockey brand items but it unfortunately didn't and now I have to find a new favorite.",Wish this could have been a better review...

In the past, I have used North Face waterproof hiking shoes.  Unfortunately, the first time I got to use my new Montrails was last month. What I found was very disappointing. My feet normally sweat very little. However, with these shoes my feet were soaked with sweat and the shoes literally stunk up the whole hotel room. I experienced this again on a second attempt.

I am curvy and the size up fits perfectly around my chest but then it turns into huge old lady muumuu below with tons of room to spare. If you could get over the fact it's see-thru it would work well for someone pregnant. I am also on the short side so the dress length hits just below my knees. Pretty much the fit is completely wrong for me and overwhelms my petite frame with chest & hips.

I haven't worn them other than inside the house, but they feel like they would hurt your feet if you don't add insoles for extra support. I'd suggest going up another half size to make room for socks and insoles. I'll have to use thin insoles especially since the left shoe is tighter. They feel a little stiff, but I think that they will probably stretch and flex fine after wearing them. They have good traction on wood floors and don't slide when I walk. I'm not sure how well they will do on snow or ice. I'm disappointed in the marks and glue, but it's not worth the $$ to ship these back for a refund.

2,"I purchased this set because I have a hard time sleeping and a hard time waking up in the morning.  I have tried a lot of things and if you have this problem you will understand the willingness to spend whatever money it takes to find a solution to the debilitating effects of insomnia.  So when I found this, I was desperate enough to give it a try, thinking that $600.00 would be a small price to pay it is worked.  I was very disappointed - both with the quality of this watch set and with the effectiveness to solve my sleep/wake issues.

The quality is poor.  The bands are a white, squishy silicone that gets horribly dirty very, very fast and there is no way to clean it.  Even the sleep band, (which I only wear at night in a clean bed) was dingy and grimy after the first use, making the set unreturnable.  For the life of me, I cannot figure out how it got dirty, as I had brand new sheets and showered before going to bed.  But come morning, it looked like it was years old!

The daytime watch was no better.  It is nothing special to look at and the white band looks dirty very quickly.  Even worse, it will not stay buckled and so I am always having to struggle with keeping the strap from flapping wildly and looking like I am not very ""put together"".  They really could have done better than this!

As far as the technology is concerned, I couldn't tell that it helped me resolve my daytime energy issues or my night time relaxation issues.  I think it is a gimmick and I wasted $600.00.  I was willing to spend that money in hopes that it would help me, AND because this was a ""free return"" item.  But be aware that the ""free return"" offer only applies to brand new, UNUSED items, so if you use it enough to realize that it doesn't help anything, you will have voided the option to return it.  Especially because the white bands start looking dirty from the very start.

The good news is that I actually have found a device that is awesome to regulate my sleep/wake cycles and it has done what the Phillip Stein gimmick watch did not do.  It is called ReTIMER LIGHT THERAPY GLASSES.  You can purchase them here:

https://amazon.com/ReTimer-Light-Therapy-Glasses-Generation/dp/B01GGN0PAO/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1479835991&sr=8-1&keywords=retimer+light+therapy+glasses

I loved the Light Therapy Glasses, but the Phillip Stein Watch and Sleep Band set was a big disappointment.  Poor Quality and Ineffective.

I give the Phillip Stein watch and sleep band 2 stars instead of 1 star because the watch does keep time, but no better than this similar looking $25.00 Timex:

https://amazon.com/Timex-T20041-Reader-Brown-Leather/dp/B000B55AEA/ref=sr_1_77?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1479848558&sr=1-77&nodeID=7141123011&keywords=timex+watch+women&refinements=p_89%3ATimex

The Timex is better on so many levels - 1)  Genuine Leather Strap,  2)  More Functions (shows date), 3) Easier to Read, 4.  Interchangeable Timex Watch Bands that cost around $10.00 each AS OPPOSED TO THE Philip Stein Watch Bands that sell for between $50.00 - $250.00 each.

It doesn't do anything for your boobs, the feathers actually kinda hide the cleavage. The bodice in general is very short. I am only 5 ft tall so how it looks so long on the model is beyond me. I wish this product was less expensive seeing as it is a one time use, it can't be washed due to the feathers. The zipper is a nice touch but I would prefer it to be closer to the back.

2,"I had wanted to get an M65, but just a cheap kick-around one for use on my college campus.

I kindof knew what I was buying into since alpha no-longer makes these ""like they used to"", but admittedly I was surprised when having opened the package and putting it on the first thing that occurred was that a snap button had partially ripped its fabric enclosure.
I proceeded to fix that little bit with stitching and otherwise for the last 3 months the coat held up decent. That is untill today when the same snap button completely ripped out of its enclosure.

Looking at this coat now, I'll just call it a complete loss.
The collar is weakly stitched on and is beginning to rip off with normal day-to-day wear, the buttons litterally have nothing holding them in place, and the don't get me started on the useless Velcro and *grungey* patches.

It's quite apparent to me now that alpha is but a shell of its former contractor days building these en-masse for the US government, using the cheapest materials and laziest methods possible for the sole purpose of ""looking good"" without bearing the quintessential qualities of durability and pure functionality inherent in the older field coats such as the (real) m65s and their predecessors.

The Good:  Very well made shoe, and if it fits you, I'm pretty confident it would be a comfortable shoe.  Very attractive shoe and the leather quality appears to be high.  The footbed of this shoe seems to suggest it would be comfortable for a long day on your feet, with decent arch support and a foam pad at the toe box that would relieve pressure there. I particularly like the heel design of this shoe, that higher design would avoid blisters and help keep the shoe in place.

The Bad:  The shoe sizing runs both short and narrow.  I ordered an 11M, and it was way too short, fit more like a 10 in most other brands.  So I would recommend trying a size up in this shoe.  They don't offer a 12 so I don't have that option - a big driver for my low rating.  In addition, I think the shoe seemed just a little narrow for a medium width, particularly in the toe area (note that it is not a pointy toed shoe).  So if you sometimes wear a wide shoe, this is a shoe you definitely need a wide width in.

Bottom line:  I'm disappointed they didn't work for me, but they might work for you as long as you don't wear a size 11.","Beautiful, well-made shoe, BUT... runs really small"
2,"I wanted to love these but after a couple of hours of walking around, the top of my foot started hurting a lot and the shoes gave me bruises. Also, the inside of the shoe (where by heel goes) started coming apart and caused my heels to also hurt.

2,"OK, I expect Gabby Skye dresses to be a little on the short side for me as I am 5'8"". Unfortunately, Amazon's models are almost always super long-legged and most of the time, the actual dresses are longer than what's pictured. Not in this case, however. This dress almost came halfway up my thigh. With the volume of the skirt, it just looked ridiculous, never mind the fact that I don't wear such short dresses over 40. Unfortunately, there was hardly any fabric turned up under the hem (as there usually is), so there is no way to make the dress longer.

It is unfortunate because the dress would be super cute if it hit at or just above the knee. At its current length, it just looks silly. I think the only females who could away with this are teenagers and maybe some young 20somethings. If you are over 30, pass on this.",Way too short!

2,"I had high hopes after reading all the reviews.

I wear a size 10 and have flat feet, plantar fasciitis and tarsal tunnel syndrome. The cork bottom was quick drying and had an interesting feeling on the foot. The upper material was soft against the skin so I doubt it would rub.
The sandal was a snug fit in the heel and toes. Technically, it was a perfect fit...until I tried walking. I found my heel striking the edge which only served to aggravate my heel pain further. (Minus one star). Although the company states that the sandel relieves heel pain, just standing, the material cupped the heel well, but no real padding or elevation which helped (Minus one star).
I could feel the built in arch support which was great, but the material on the bottom of the sandal is rounded, curving up where the arch is which leaves a space between the sandal and the ground. This allows the the foot to pronate as weight is placed on the sandel which defeats the entire purpose of having a built in arch. (Minus one star).

I really wanted to like the sandal, and for most Im sure it would be fine. But the arch was the deal breaker for me. For anyone with mechanical Tarsal tunnel, avoid this sandal AT ALL COST. It is not for you. The allowed pronation by the arch will make the condition worse...quickly.

But the strap that is pictured is not the strap it comes with. It pictures a sewn in halter, which is the entire reason I chose this suit. But it comes with one of those flimsy, removable straps, like the ones that come with strapless bras. Newsflash clothes makers of this size clothing: that strap is a joke for this bust size. I was dumb and tried to wear it anyway and after one time wearing it in the water it holes to put the hooks in are completely frayed, the strap popped off repeatedly, and my neck was in pain from the thin pinching of the strap tightened to hold up the girls. So, I'm stuck with it and will likely have to sew on some homemade straps to make this expensive purchase work out. It's a shame because this is the most flattering suit I've ever owned.

2,"I originally gave this top three stars, because I thought it ""okay.""  However, after washing it twice, I've down graded it. The quality of this item is poor - the inside seams are a mess; There was a a strong chemical smell when I first pulled it out of the packaging, but I thought a wash would take care of that. Two washes later, the scent (tho much less) is still there.  However, in fairness to the product it is NOT cotton (100% acrylic), which also means there is very little shrinkage.

Keep in mind that although it looks roomy in the picture, their ""one size fits all"" presentation truly means this is a one size fits medium. Pay attention to the measurement chart they provide. For a person who wears a medium (size 10-12 US), the sleeves JUST hit your wrists, it is snug (not loose as the picture presents). The weave is loose at the sides (by design) you must wear a T-shirt under it. Would I call it a ""cable"" sweater? No.

2,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for our anniversary, and he loved it when I gave it to him, but sadly since he has had an allergic reaction to it. He is only allergic to nickle and I got this watch because I believed it was made with stainless steal so that he would have no problem. Obviously this watch was made with a cheaper stainless steal that contains some nickle, it must not contain enough for them to have felt the need to say it contains nickle but it was enough to give him hives and make it so he's unable to wear the watch.
With how long it would take to deliver I ordered the watch in advance to our anniversary, unfortunately for my boyfriend and myself our anniversary was on May 11th, and the end of my return time was May 5th so we're likely out of luck here, and it took him a couple weeks to realize it was the watch causing the reaction since we had believed it to be safe.

But the footbed is not cushioned, nor textile covered.  It is hard plastic/rubber and provides no cushioning at all. No arch support either, not that I need it but some people might.

-The ear wire is stamped 92.5 for sterling silver, but the discs are not. I am very sensitive to nickel. They hang to about the jawline, and do brush against the neck. Skin irritation tells me if something is not 92.5 sterling silver. The earrings do NOT seem to be sterling silver, as they have made my neck itchy!

I really wanted to like them and I would have if the elastic around the legs had been done differently. Instead of a flat smooth piece of elastic,  they used two strands of very small round chord type elastic, fully exposed to the skin. So instead of being flat and smooth against the toddlers skin there were 2 raised cords. It marked her skin in only a few minutes of trying them on even though they weren't tight.

2,"I purchased these shoes to wear on a trip to Europe (Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome) in the early spring. I wanted a pair of comfortable shoes that wouldn't scream ""tourist"" if at all possible.

The good:
- Neutral color, made of leather
- Good arch support (I have high arches and they definitely worked).

The bad:
-The heel rubs. Even through socks. I got some blisters on my heels from these shoes, and still have to break them in each season
- The leather became damaged quickly. I wore these shoes every other day for 2 weeks. Granted I was hard on these shoes (probably 8-10 miles of walking in dusty conditions a day). I was amazed at how quickly they looked scuffed and the color was worn away. I probably should have put some leather protectant on them before I took them on my trip, but I didn't. They are now so worn I don't really like to wear them in public. My leather boots (put through the same schedule) came out much better
- My feet hurt. This is likely because I switched from high-arch supporting shoes (these) to boots (another comfort brand) but my feet didn't feel awesome at the end of the day. They felt good for 6 hrs, but anything more than that, my feet hurt at the end of the day
- Poor traction. I thought these shoes would be fine on wet surfaces (after it rained) or on slippery stone. There was more than one occasion where I thought I would fall because these shoes didn't provide enough traction on the surface. I never did fall, but I came close. If you wanted shoes that could handle the rain, I would try something else. Purely because you may not be able to stand.","Good idea, but high arches, leather wears quickly, and slippery traction."

Sadly when it finally got here, the experience was very disappointing.  The stole is quite thin and the fur not of high quality.  Considered the price I paid, this is not my gripe.  My complain concerns the poor workmanship.  The fur was knitted on a net like structure which gives it the shape of the stole/shawl.  The piece sent to me has a ""bald spot"" measuring the size of approximately 4 square inches near the back of collar that has very little fur.  One of the pockets also has a small rip.  I took pictures of the problem and emailed to the seller requesting for an exchange.  I was told by Linda that because the piece is handmade, it cannot be 100% perfect.  That, I understand and did not expect 100% perfection.  However, what I expect is simply a product that meets an acceptable standard of quality.  I had ordered this to be worn to a wedding.

2,"These are going straight back due to the unflattering and non-functional short length. I am 5'8"", which is really only slightly above average height, and they hit at least 2"" above the ankle. The model must be petite because they do not fit at all like the picture shows, which almost suggests she could pull them down lower below her ankle bone. (Edit: I have since noticed that an inseam of 26.5"" is listed for different style of Hue ponte leggings, which is super short and these are probably the same length. I would never have ordered these had the inseam been provided in the description.)

Aside from the length issue, they do hold everything in as promised. They are really high-waisted and come up above my belly button. Personally, I'm not sure I loved the feeling of the inner mesh but it does keep your tummy and saddle bags smoothed over.

It is a real shame, because they were such cute boots. I'm dropping down my review to 2 stars however since the zipper broke so easily. Buyer beware...

These boots are very cute and fit well.  The inside zipper up the side helps tremendously with getting them on and off.  They are very comfortable and light.  I have worn them several times in the last week since getting them.  They are also great for those of us blessed with large calves.  The fact that you can untie the laces and tighten them to your liking is awesome.  I get lots of comments on them.  My only complaints are that the laces tend to squeak when you walk but I am hoping that that will wear down over time.  Also, the inside zippers tend to stick and come apart if you don't have the sides of the zippers right next to each other.  I have to unlace mine every time I put them on just so I can get the zippers up.  I think that just comes with having large calves.  Other than those 2 things, I love the crap out of these boots and would definitely recommend them!","so sad, these were so cute at first..."

2,"I received this hat today.  My wife laughs at me saying that I have more hats than she has shoes.  I absolutely love hats.  For my favorite hats, I will sometimes buy two, so I can wear one out, and know I have another.  This is to say that I was really looking forward to this one and was disappointed when I got it and put it on.

Pros
- I looks great
- It has a Velcro enclosure
- the bill of the hat is very sturdy, with nice edging around the bill
- the camo design is nice
- The stitching on the front and the side Navy seals is nice

Cons
- It is made in China
- Its tag says 100% acrylic
- The front two panels of the dome of the hat is study in front, with the main seal, but the back four panels are very light weight, flimsy even
- When I hold the bill of the hat, the material is such that the back of the hat slumps down
- It is not the sturdy material and stitching of the hats I had when in the Navy or any of the other hats I would purchase if I picked it up off a shelf
- While the hat has a Velcro closure, it is as flimsy, like the back of the hat
- With my other hats, the dome of the hat is taller, when I push the metal tab on top, there is about an inch of air above... With this hat, with the correct Velcro set, there is almost no room at the top of my hat.

Final... That hat looks great, but, to me, seems to have cut corners to save some dollars.  I have another Navy camo hat I found out of the Washington/Dulles hat of al places, made in the US, very study material and Velcro closure.  Next time I went back through, I stopped by the same store and purchased another one.

Honestly, If I was in a store, I would have been drawn to this hat.  I would have picked it up, seen the flimsy material and probably not even tried it on, that if I had, the shallowness of the hat would have had me put it back on the shelf and look for another one.  I would return it, but it is just not worth the effort.  I may become something I use in the garage or when mowing a lawn, something that can get messy and then get thrown away.",Looks can be deceiving

2,"I ordered the white satin color in these shoes. I usually wear a size 7.5 but the shoe was rather large.. I had about a half inch of space yet to fill the rest of the shoe. So I suggest ordering a half size or maybe even a full size down. I also noticed that the box they came in was pretty damaged and looked like it's been tossed around. So I open the box and see the two shoes. I immediately knew they were too big. I noticed that one of the shoes had 2 brown stains on the left and right side of the shoe. Another thing is, is that the bottom of the platform on the shoes don't have any traction at all. Only the heel has some. I tried walking around in them and they were quite slippery.

2,"I really want to love these shoes, but I just cannot give them a good review. My twin boys got them for preschool, which they started on November 1. It is now November 22, and these shoes are starting to fall apart. The tab on the heel ripped right off the first time I put one of my son's shoes on the first day of school. Now, 3 weeks later, the bungee shoe laces have completely broken. My other son's laces are showing the same signs of wear and will likely be broken when I pick them up from school today...Not that it matters much because the plastic clip to hold the laces tight when the shoe is on never stays put, and the laces loosen. I never felt this was much of an issue since the shoes stay on my boys feet well, even being a bit big on them. But now that the laces have completely broken, I'm not sure how well these will stay on.
In my experience, these are not water proof. Stomping through some shallow puddles at the park has always resulted in sopping wet socks.
The only good things I can say about the shoe is that the tread is great, they probably would be good for hiking (if we ever got the chance to try them out on a trail before they started falling to pieces) and they look nice.
My boys are 3, and while they do play hard, the wear on these shoes is much greater than I would expect from this type of shoe from a company like Columbia. Guess I should've just cheaped out on the vinyl character shoes from Walmart. At least I wouldn't be so disappointed when those fall apart in under a month. I will also note that I got these in 2 different sizes. So it's not like I could've just gotten a couple of ""lemons"" in the bunch.",I really want to love these shoes

Nothing in the product description indicates that these forms would have or should have been brown forms.  Luckily when I ordered, they had free returns, so I'll be taking advantage of that.  Not sure if I'll try re-ordering and see if I get pink-tone forms, but it was quite disappointing opening the box and seeing the wrong color when nothing on the product page even hinted at the forms being brown forms.

2,"I got these boots around December 5th 2017. They look just as cute in person, fit well and were fully lined with soft white sherpa on the inside. At first they were just what I wanted and I was really pleased. They kept my feet warm and dry in the rainy Washington winter weather.

However,  after wearing them for the majority of a month (maybe 20 times/days?), they were already giving out. Toward the beginning of this  month (January 2018) the sole of the left shoe started coming off!  I filled the gap with glue that is typically strong and flexible,  and let it dry. At this point, the boots do not keep my feet dry anymore. Since then I've been careful not to wear them as much, supplementing wear time by using my tennis-shoes which sadly do not keep my feet dry either.

Then last night after geting home from work I took the boots off to find the sole of the shoe was just hanging off! The ""stuffing"" between the boot and the rubber is utterly exposed. I don't think this can be fixed with glue.

I'm incredibly frustrated that these turned out to be such poor quality. I only got a month and a half out of them! And it's such a shame because they were really cute and warm. To make these last a year,  you'd only be able to wear them twice a month- and that just isn't worth it to me.","Fit well, but fell apart quickly."

4,"My son loves this particular hat and at one point wore it every single day. It is really easily adjustable. It was holding up pretty well with lots of wear and minimal fraying until we lost it after about 6-7 months. I then ordered identical hat #2, which was also doing great until another 10 months later, we left it at a hotel (who claimed they never found it). We are at hat #3 right now, only because of our own mishaps and not due to the product itself. As of the last few months, he has decided to branch out into other hats, so this one is now getting much less wear and tear. That said, it is still a really cute hat.

Highly recommended for any minion fan!",For Minion Lovers Everywhere

4,"The strap needs to be reconfigured as it tends to dig when tightened. The small rectangular plastic piece rides directly under your jawbone & the other side pushes into your throat. Once saturated, the tightness is lost unless the surfer wants to pull slack thru & tie it tight. If you do that, you add a knot to dig into the areas as well. The ear holes are great. The hat gets yanked off after every ride. It blocks your peripheral vision so much that before going for a wave you literally have to push it up to see as you're popping up. It has to be put back on & the back brim flaps up. You have to adjust it often. Why four stars? If you need to avoid skin cancer in a coastal desert & you learn to adjust quick this hat shields you well. Always use sunscreen. Sunscreen accumulates around the brim of interior of hat. When you sweat, it runs in your eyes & burns. Looks nice in camo & for avid daily surfers it works just be prepared to adjust a lot",Chinstrap needs reconfiguring
4,"The shoe is a well designed and built shoe. It is lightweight, yet amazingly functional.

I ordered the same size as my Salwa hiking boots and this one is about a half size small. I've gone through several pairs of Salewa's and always get 500 - 1000 mile of hard hiking on them. The abrasive rock in the southwest really eat up boots fast but Salewa make a tough, comfortable shoe.",comfortable shoe.
4,"I bought these boots because I was looking for a pair of 1) black 2) chunky 3)rough or masculine-looking boots and 4) FIT my large-ish calves without being tight; by ""chunky"" I mean that I wanted there to be some ""breathing room"" between my leg and the boot, a bit of a gap. I did not want ankle boots and I would have liked these to have been closer to knee-high, but because I have large-ish calves (about 15 inches in diameter), I am limited on knee-high boots that will work for me.

These are definitely not ankle boots though; they hit a little below mid-calf for me, and I am 5'6"". They fit true to size; I normally wear a 6.5 and that's what I ordered, and it fits great. I like that they can be unzipped a little for a more loose, undone look; however the zipper on the left one won't go more than half-way down. It's not a huge deal, since I can easily get them on and off despite that, but it does concern me.

They look rugged and masculine (not in a textured or damaged way, just in style; the finish of the shoe is black leather and clean), exactly what I was looking for. They are (so far) very comfortable to walk in and slip easily on and off.","True to Size, Wide Opening at Top Great for Larger Calves"

4,"I purchased this romper the first time directly from the AX Paris website. Based on their size chart, I chose a size 6. It ended up being a tad too small and shorter than I was comfortable with. It was very cute, though. I decided to return it.

Then I found it on amazon for cheaper (woo!) and ordered a size 8. The fit is better, although it is still VERY short. One thing that I'm bummed about, though, is the collar is a little bit off-center. It won't be noticeable really, but that's one little bummer (only reason it doesn't get 5 stars).

I'm 5'5"" and 125-130lbs. I'm typically a size 4 in women's dresses/pants, or a xs/s in women's tops. I'm typically a size 7-9 in juniors, or s/m. I'd say this brand runs at least one size small, maybe more depending on the item. One thing to note: the tags all had UK sizing on them, while the package sticker had both UK and US sizing. A US 6 is a UK 10. A US 8 is a UK 12. Thinking about it, the clothes probably DON'T run small, we're just used to ""vanity sizing"" in the US.","Cute romper, ok quality, runs slightly small"

This hugs my curves well and is neither too tight nor too loose. The problem with this product is that it has no working value. You cannot pull on the leash, because it is obviously very flimsy. Stretches too much due to being elastic. My boyfriend and I can't use it in the way we wanted to due to the fact that it's so flimsy.

Glue holding the leather on the buttons is already coming off (easy to reglue, but not what you'd expect after wearing only a few times) and the buttons themselves aren't stitched on real tight.  They are definitely leather (another poster claimed otherwise) and a nice shade of brown but they also seem a little fragile with the lacework.  Also, disappointed, I havent' found these boots in anything higher than a size 40 (size 9). I'm a 9.5 and a 40 works, but it's tight.",eye catching!

The only reason I gave this item 4 stars is because it has a off-white long tank or short dress attached to it, which does not appear in the photo.

4,"For fans of the show Castle, this is a wonderful item.  Creating the illusion of the infamous ""WRITER"" body armor that the title character purchases to allow him to follow the NYPD into hostile situations, this is both a simple yet effective homage to the series, as well as an advertisement of the wearer's interest in the art of putting pen to page.  I purchased mine for wearing to a National Novel Writing Month event, and was quite satisfied with the number of people that recognized it and complimented me on it.

On the negative side, the sizes seem to run a tad small, and the detail is a bit simple.  However, for the price, this does quite well.  A point that I had missed in making my purchase was the detail reflected in the ""Shot"" title of the item.  The I in WRITER is punctuated with the illusion of a bullet having struck the wearer dead over the breastbone.

If you are or know of a Castle fan, this is a good item to consider.  If you are or know of a fledgling mystery/homicide author, this is a good item.  If you are hoping to do a bit of Rick Castle/Nicki Heat cos-play, this would be an economical starting point.",It gets the point across nicely.

I liked those so much that I decided to buy a pair of the pink ones a gift.  I was so excited, the pink in the picture looks like cherry blossoms and completely lovely.  The earrings I received were so light pink that you could forget they were pink at all.  And they were such a dull colored pink when you noticed the color at that.  No where near as bright and cheerful as this picture made them out to be.  I still like them, but I am reconsidering giving them as a gift they were intended to be.  4 stars says ""I like it"" according to the rating system so that is what they will get from me,  but I think it should be more of a 3 1/2 stars.",These are very pretty earrings.

4,"This umbrella comes with a nice sleeve for carrying, opens quickly, and stays open. however, the colors were not what I expected. I expected a blue and white umbrella, but the reality is that the white is oddly yellowed. It's just cosmetic, but it is not attractive. The material and stitching are all just fine, so in the end, it doesn't really matter. I do see that other reviews have pictures without this color discrepancy, so I am wondering if it is unique to my model or not.

My other gripe about it is the handle. It's pill-shaped rather than being cylindrical, which I automatically wasn't a huge fan of. The rectangular edges are far less ergonomic than the traditional round handle. It is also SMALL. I am a woman with average sized hands, and this handle is dwarfed by my hands to the point where I have trouble getting a decent grip on it. The wrist strap will surely help with that and it does not interfere with its function at all. The button to open the umbrella seems sturdy and opens the umbrella reliably and quickly. I would probably purchase a different umbrella in the future, but that is due to personal preference, not any fatal defect with this product. I do plan on using it and expect that it will serve my needs just fine.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am neither a shill nor a yes-woman and the above represents my honest opinions regarding this product.",This umbrella comes with a nice sleeve for carrying
4,Very good quality. Theybfit nice,Four Stars
4,"...for the accurate reviews regarding the narrow width of this sandal. For that reason I ordered a half-size larger, hoping to accommodate for the narrow width-- so glad I did. Since having surgery on my right foot a couple of years ago, it often swells. I would not be able to wear this sandal were it not for the extra with of a half-size larger. Cole Haans seem to run a little short for me, anyway, so the half-size doesn't make a lot of difference in length. After wearing them, off-and-on for about a week, they're a bit more comfortable. There's no width indicated, so one would assume they are medium width. Can't help wondering if this lot of sandals was purchased as a buyout from factory rejects. At any rate, this is a cute shoe and seems well-made, but anyone with less than narrow feet, beware.",Thank goodness...

It turns out return requests need to be approved by the seller (but are currently free once approved). The color is beautiful--dark bluish olivish green, kind of. Someone described it as sap green and it is like that--Google the color to get some ideas of what it would look like in real life. It is a color that would look good on most people, I think.

4,"This is the perfect watch for small-wristed business women. I recommend it to young female professionals, much like myself. I began my search for a new watch with a few criteria in mind. Firstly, I wanted a professional watch that could be worn at my work or during important special events. I had a particular style in mind for my watch: something simple, neutral in color, with perhaps a small amount of jewels. This was important to me so that I may wear the watch with many different outfits without worrying about it matching in color or style with the clothes I wore. Pricing was important to me as well, as I did not want to spend too much on an accessory. Lastly, I was looking specifically for a small-faced watch with a thin-width band. I did not want the watch to be so large that it appeared gaudy.

This product was one of the first that could be found that met the above criteria. The Kate Spade watch would immediately grab any professionals attention because of the stylish appearance: neutral color and small band and face. It fit within the $125-$150 price range that most college students can reasonably afford. It was ordered and the watch arrived in the mail in perfect condition, and exceeded my expectations for style and professionalism. It is very exciting to open the package to find a very cute, colorful Kate Spade box, which can serve you as a durable storage for the watch in the future. Some more qualities that customers would find very appealing about the watch is the jewel-studded face and the overall functionality.

Kate Spade is considered a high-quality, high-price brand. You will be happy to find that this watch has both a reasonable price and high quality. It is easy to clean, which was needed because clothes often rub against the wrist band and transfer some color to the beige leather. This discoloration easily comes off when you wash it off with a bit of water.

Overall, I think you will be pleased with this watch. It is safe to say that you will get your moneys worth. I encourage you to purchase it and see for yourself!","High Quality, Reasonable Price"

I didn't need to buy an expensive bra to fit the dress.

Now the problem I had was that the space from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the armpit was too small. I understand that this would not be a common problem. I took it to the woman who alters my ASUs and she took part of the ribbon from the from tie and added an insert that made it able for me to actually put my arms through the holes.

I got a 3XL for my fianc, which is what he usually wears, and they were huge on him. So I had to send them back for a 2XL, which were still a little big.

Only real complaint I have is when I returned them nothing was stated about a restocking fee.  Had I known they would take over half the price of the pants for a restocking fee, I would have just kept them.",Really REALLY warm pants
4,"People are not joking around about the sizing of these shoes. I even used the size chart and fit guide on the Climb X website and still ended up having to order 3 pair before I got the right size. I usually wear a womens 7.5 in street shoes and ended up ordering a size 8 (mens). They are snug, but feel like climbing shoes are supposed to.

4,"The insole is removable, which is nice because it feels too warm in warmer weather. I slid in one of my own insoles, and its fine. The leather is top quality and soft. It feels lighter than it looks, and although there is no wide sizes, it doesn't feel narrow at all.  The brown is a little darker than the picture. If you apply any oil or leather protectant, it would probably look more like the black color option. Very comfortable, even on the first day of wear.
The only thing I do not like is that darker toe area. I never understand the purpose of this style, but its OK when done appropriately. On my shoes, the separation of color is too distinct. Think of a clear line dividing the darker toe area from the rest of the shoe. They could have done that better...",Nice

He is 6 foot 3....a big guy, but tall and thin, so I wasn't sure this would fit him, but the XL fit him just fine.  He loves it.  The only downside is that it took forever to ship, since it's coming from Asia I believe....so we did not get it in time for Halloween, although we ordered it a couple weeks before Halloween.  It took a long, long time to ship. So, if you need this costume fast...it's not gonna happen.  Other than that, my son says it is big and comfy and he will use it next year for Halloween I'm sure or at special days at work at the reptile facility.",but the XL fit him just fine. He loves it

They fit well, I was told they are a little narrow so I am happy with the size 6s (Fluevog models vary a lot from style to style so this is normal).

The only thing I don't like about these shoes is that the blue leather swirl came unglued on one of the shoes and it's pretty annoying. I keep reattaching it but it slides all over the place. The swirl on the other shoe stays in place.  This is why I gave them a 4 and not a 5.",I really like these Fluevogs

4,"For western buyers, note that Asian sizes are different, and there is no simple conversion.
For reference, note:
In blazers I wear a US size 38R to 40R (depending on cut, style, etc.).
In dress shirts I wear a slim fit 16x35.
Waist size 30-32

For this jacket I returned the L for an XL. The XL is fitted in the shoulders (like a US size 38R), relaxed in the body (like a US size 40R), and super-fitted in the sleeves.  I definitely cannot wear more than a dress shirt under this (i.e. no sweaters). I put it on with a sweater and could barely get my arms through the sleeves, and once I did I didn't have full range of motion. Finally, the sleeves are a little on the short side, especially if you are thinking of this as an outerwear jacket.

For a better fit, I modified the jacket:  I took the lining out of the sleeves. While I still can't fit a sweater under the jacket, the sleeves are now much more comfortable.

Finally, pay very close attention to the seller's returns policy. Shipping back to China can cost you more than the jacket is worth.",Great Jacket if you get the right size

Also, I do believe these were used prior to me buying them and that's probably why they were marked down. They came in the original Jessica Simpson shoe box (it looks extremely old, the corners are starting to cave and there's scratches all over.) The shoes also look a LITTLE worn from the bottom and again, there's a couple signs of wear on each shoe.... Nothing that I couldn't fix though. Keep in mind if they are marked down, they might've been returned or were used! It's ambiguous on here. Definitely a fair price though for what they are.

4,I really like the color and functionality of the watch. It fits well and the square face is unique and cool. Color of the digits is very clear which I like. The main critique I have is that the top right button toggles between two preset times you can setup. This mades it easy to toggle between times - especially if you travel quite a bit. The challenge is that this button can be inadvertently engaged when your wrist is cocked back and the time zones switch without you wanting them too. I wish this had a click & hold feature to avoid this from happening. Otherwise - great watch.

4,"I just love this bracelet despite a major flaw. It looks really sweet on, isn't noisy and has wonderful color in the jade. The elephants are very uniform. Please know that this is not a bracelet for a large wrist. I have a 6"" wrist and the bracelet is a couple millimeters shy of 7"". This fits me just fine. Anyone witheven slightly larger bones would not be able to wear it.

The clasp is very cheap, like something you'd see on gum ball machine jewelry. I like this so much that I took it to my long suffering jeweler who put a safety on for me. He said he could improve the clasp and I am considering it. He did the safety chain while I waited (10$).

Despite that I like this bracelet enough to give it 4 stars. I find it very whimsical and charming.",Just darling. Not a high quality clasp. For small wrists only.

 We went to a shoe store and had her foot measured, right at an 8. They recommended going for a size 9 if we had to choose between the two. I ordered an 8 and should have stuck with a 7. She'll grow into them.
I do like the Velcro on the tongue of the shoe. It's nice to be able to show a kid how to straighten up the tongue, and this one won't move after fastened correctly.
 The lights are very bright! The jewels on the toe of the shoe sparkle in the sun. Unfortunately, we've already lost three of them somewhere in the house. And they are tiny.

4,"I wanted to keep this jumpsuit, I really did... The material was lovely and flowy and the whole thing is adorable. In 3.5"" heels it hit just to the floor on me. Unfortunately it had a couple things completely wrong with it! The first was the size -- I am 5'4"" 105lbs and the small was too small. I could still put it on and it looked cute, but sitting down in it was really constricting around the waistband. Forget eating dinner in this thing! The second issue was the zipper in back. Extremely cute, and I loved the cutout! However, it was very difficult to zip (even when I wasn't wearing it!) and it would take me a good 5 minutes trying to do it behind my back. Normally it would be okay to have someone else zip me, but you would have to unzip it and rezip it every time you needed to use the restroom! Not okay! There should have been no zipper or a fake zipper in back, and a small hidden zipper down the side. Also one last issue that I almost forgot - the elastic band that wraps around your waist in back is thick and the kind that twists and rolls over itself. Just taking it off once made the elastic twist inside and require it to be smoothed out with fingers.

Sadly I am returning this item. I would consider getting a size up, but I do think the zipper issue was the biggest dealbreaker for me. If you're willing I would suggest bringing it to the tailor to add a side zipper, and perhaps place some reinforcement within the elastic to prevent twisting.","Super cute! Too small, zipper a pain"

Then only offence against it is a big one, which is why it gets a star knocked off - the design of the necklace makes it impossible to wear with a knitted sweater. And knitted sweaters are my favorite kind of sweaters! If it's not the long rope chain that gets attached to something (including my hair), it's the edges of the pendant itself!
This ruined one of my favorite sweaters from me having to pull the sweater out of it so many times in one night till finally, I had to take it off. So moral of the story, don't wear with knitted sweaters! Other than that- great cheap costume jewelry.","I want to give it 5 stars, but..."

4,"I was really looking forward to receiving this bag.  I love the idea of an all leather backpack.  Leather is so durable and versatile.

My first impression upon seeing it in person was that visually, I did not like it.  I like the color of the leather however.  I jus think that there are many details to the bag that are just ugly, in my opinion.

I still am rating this bag 4-stars based on its durability and craftsmanship.  Design wise, I think it needs to go back to the drawing table.

Here is what I don't like about the bag:
The leather is very stiff.
The bag is super heavy, even when completely empty.
The zippers get stuck easily.
The label ""Xiangyu"" is printed very largely on the front of the bag and on all of the zippers.
The bag is much smaller than a standard sized backpack.
It is ugly.
It is covered in very small useless pockets.
The inside of the bag is made up of a very thin cream colored material.  (I'm thinking pen ink stains are in my future.)
The straps have a big zipper going down them that is just unnecessary.

As far as what I do actually like about the bag, the list is much smaller.
The hardware is durable.
The bag will last for many years because of quality materials.
The leather bag ships in a canvas pouch for protection.  I have found it to be very useful.

If you are wanting any leather bag then the price is definitely right on this one.  If you are wanting a nice leather bag then maybe spring for something a little pricier that has better design and more practicality.

I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for this honest and unbiased review.  These opinions and thoughts are strictly my own and were not influenced in any way by my purchase price or any discount received on my purchase price.","4-stars based on its durability and craftsmanship.  Design wise, I think it needs to go back to the drawing table."

4,"I ordered a size large and it is slightly large but because the waist has a drawstring, I can pull it tight around the waist. It bunches up a bit around the waist, the jacket is so adorable and still looks good. However, if you don't like a slightly shabby look, you won't want this jacket.  I am normally a size 8-10. I am 54, 145lbs, 38C bust and 29 waist.  Again, the size large was a little big.  The khaki color makes it so I can wear it with brown, black, white or blue. The jackets works great with jeans or slacks with flats or heels.  Another thing, don't get this jacket if you do not like to iron.  I don't mind ironing so its not a big deal for me, but once it is washed, the jacket is quite wrinkly. I did not give it 5 stars because the material is quite lightweight making it so the jacket does not hang stiff, therefore, why I said it has that shabby look instead of a crisp look.","Shabby, not crisp, but nice lightweight jacket"

Do buy size up for options on socks lol.  I also see some of threading. However the rest of the boot seems good.  Have worn them in snow wasn't sure about dye but did fine, no they are not a snow boot not sure how anyone is confused on that but sole does not have any grip.  Theyre warm and cozy though.

I didn't rate them for how long I can wear them comfortably because I think I fall somewhere between ""all day"" and a ""couple hours"" (I bought them as warm-weather house shoes, not for going on long walks). I have very high arches and expected more arch support based on other reviews, so I didn't rate them on this since the choices were Y/N with nothing in between, which is where I'd put them.

I am a 12-14 bottom and the Large fit well but being that I will wear to swim, and will wear a swim trunk under it, I felt the XL was a better choice.

4,"Unboxing reveals a smart looking boot with light weight as a bonus. Usually try and buy wide sizes, but since there were none-to-be had, when new they were snug for my size (10.5).  But not to worry after break-in, takes a about a week of casual use, these boots fit nicely with no hot spots.  Arch support is better than most for out of the box insoles, so you can save your money buying expensive aftermarket insoles.  The real reason for my interest in these is the Vibram soles, a feature that is a must have for me.  It can be claimed Vibrams' are soft and wear fast, and you would not be too far from the truth.  Traction while walking sidehill in soft dirt is outstanding, like riding a dirt bike with new tires after a steady rain.  Usually wear out the soles of my hiking boots before the uppers, but its just as well since the scratches and tears of normal use make replacement not so painful.  Since my vanity requires nice looking boots to wear in public, the black colorway on these is especially sharp while wearing the Los Angeles power suit, Black Levis'-Black/white striped shirt-Black jacket-Black Ray Bans-Black boots.

My only complaint is that I wish that they went up higher on his leg, but I couldn't pass up these based on the price and quality compared to other brands with similar characteristics.

The boot appears to be made of quality material. And the Bigs brand was recommended to us by a family member based on their experience with the company. The leather and stitching look strong. The rubber soles also look like they are made well.

4,nice jacket but the color is a bit different than the photo.  The fake leather has more of a two toned effect of a light and slightly darker cream color.  I am not crazy about the gray hoodie that is attached but it can easily be tucked inside the back without looking lumpy for a more dressy appearance.  I bought it for my teen son and he is pleased with the jacket and wears it almost daily.  It seems to be a good fit and fits pretty true to size for him.,You can hide the hoodie

4,"My little one has smaller feet and Trumpette socks were recommended as socks that stay on. They do stay on her feet a little better than others, and she will grow into them, but they still slip off her heel somewhat. However, everywhere I go, she gets compliments on how cute they are. The sparkle on the Mary Jane shape also catches her attention; so she explores her feet more often when wearing these socks. There is a tiny bit of pilling after a couple of washes but it is not as noticeable and not as much as other socks I bought at the same time. These were a very good value for the money, and I would buy them again.","Good value, very cute, but a little big."

4,"At 2"" wide, this filigree costume jewelry pendant is meant to be a focal point, and can be dressed up or down.

Even though it is a production piece, it is quite pretty and looks delicate.  It is not flashy or gaudy, but the size and design makes you take notice.

The downside is the chain, which is too delicate for the piece. The chain should be a solid gold chain similar to the outside of the pendant.  The chain is adjustable, which is good, but it is not adjustable enough to fit petites - at least not adjustable enough to fit so the pendant rests right below the neck.

Overall, this pendant is a nice piece, and everyone I've shown it to likes it.  Most think the price point should be under fifty dollars because it is costume/production and everyone thinks the chain is too delicate.","2"" pendant - Pretty Filagree Makes for a Nice Statement Piece. Chain is too Delicate."

There is one large pocket on the inside, along with a zipper pocket in the lining that's about big enough for a wallet.
The two pockets on the outside close with snap closures (not the magnetic ones) and are a bit hard to use if you want to close them after retrieving your belongings each time.
The two pockets on the sides do seem to be more for decoration, however, I unbuckled one of them, and was able to fit my phone in there (Samsung GS3 with gel case). Too much effort to re-buckle the pocket to keep things in there though.

Engaging the spring bars was easy because of a nifty hook that makes it easy.  Too easy, in hindsight, as both spring bars snapped out over the following few weeks.  And again, the watchband width was definitely correct, an additional mm would not have fit.

Fortunately I had preserved the old watchband's spring bars.  Less fancy, and harder to engage, but solid and not prone to disengage.","Nice armband, but beware of undersized spring bars"

The bars however are a different story, keep in mind I was using them for my tongue. I love how small the metal ball is, and the clear ball was great until I accidentally bit down on it and it shattered in my mouth (again, don't hold this against the seller, I get too enthusiastic about cheese burgers) but the post itself isn't my favorite to wear. At first the flat bit was nice but eventually I felt pain whenever I talked or coughed. The flat metal part was cutting up the underside of my tongue and gums.

The Jubilee bracelet is very comfortable and the clasp, while taking some getting used to, is pretty cool.  You get the security of a bracelet with the function of a strap since you can open it up like a strap.  The clasp also has a small spring to it, allowing for wrist expansion when it's warmer (not enough for a true divers extension).  Finishing is nice, though I'd appreciate a signed crown.  Also, the crown screws down, but it cross threads easily (a common complaint with this watch).  You have to be careful screwing it down to avoid cross threading.

There is a large zippered inside pocket as well as two smaller pockets.  What I don't like is the graphics are upside down!!  I'm really disappointed in that.

I am not a huge fan of Orvis especially after I was in the market for a vest two years ago, went into one of their stores and had a sales person find five of them in my size only to discover none of them would close after opening them so I could try them on. Yes, Orvis zippers can be that bad. This sweater is beautiful though - but I wouldn't have bought it if it weren't for Amazon.com.

With regard to sizing, I am in between medium and large and according to their sizing chart, large should work for me. Wrong. This sweater is pretty big. Returning it for a medium.

The zipper works just about well enough so this style of sweater is a keeper. Phew. Regardless, the weight and feel of this sweater is awesome. Love the lining. I bought it for working in an office without heat on cool fall days and it will definitely work for that. Going outdoors with it is certainly a possibility also.","Beautifully made, hefty yet comfortable"

4,"My daughter used this for a 2 week trip and got complements on it, e.g. ""is this bulletproof""? It does have a glossy finished exterior and is sturdy. It has 4 sets of wheels instead of just 2 so it can roll/swivel when standing upright. It has a TSA-compatible combo lock that is simple to set a new code on - be sure to read the directions though as we were a little confused as how to open it! Our lock though is loose and can stick out of the bag -
 it needs some glue or something, but it still works.

This bag counts as a carry-on but is too big for a personal item. The telescoping handle works great for shorter or taller people. There wasn't a name card built in, which I prefer as the tie-on ones can break off more easily. it also doesn't have a handle on the wheel side, which would really help pulling it from overhead bins (wheels out often fits better).

4,"(update in parenthesis)

Pros:
1st star up - Love the pattern, style, and look of the colors (My wife's strong approval also helped)
2nd star up - Reasonable value at under thirty bucks for a leather name brand wallet
3rd star up - at a Deal of the day price of under twenty bucks, I couldn't resist

Cons:
1st star down (no longer an issue) - Material - The outside has a suede feel, which will definitely attract dirt and will be hard to maintain. (The suede feel went away, but the material / design ended up looking like normal leather and has held up well).
2nd star down - Size (Still an issue, but I've gotten used to it) - My old Hilfiger wallet had two credit card pockets on one side and a clear ID case on the other with back pockets behind each, so I was looking forward to this one having 3 pockets on each side. However, using the same contents the additional pockets (leather + credit cards) made it MUCH thicker than my previous wallet.

As a Deal of the Day it is a good value & style for under twenty bucks, but I foresee this lasting only until I find a better fit.","Nice quality, unique wallet"

The watch arrived well packaged and complete with a simple ""how to wind a manual watch"" type of instructions. The watch feels durable, solid and well constructed. The back plate is clear which affords a nice view into the gear section of the watch. The face is vibrant and the hands are thick enough to easily read. The numeric are vibrant and has the same color / tone as the watch's body. (in the gold / brown leather version) The genuine leather band is acceptable and the buckle is good. Be mindful before ordering as this is a manual wind / no battery watch. And if you don't wind it often the time will need to be reset upon each wear.","Durable, Attractive, Vibrant colors, gear section sightglass on back."

4,"I really love that this wristlet has two completely separate compartments so that I can place my iphone in its own compartment.  Its a great way to protect your phone from getting scratched by other items in your bag.  As the compartments are separated by two layers of the faux leather instead of just fabric, it provides MUCH better protection than most bags.  The color is great but it is a little darker than what is pictured.  More like a royal blue.  I also really like the heart pattern.

Now for the Negatives.  First of all, there are no credit card slots or small zippered pockets for cash.  I think this is a major oversight and really limits the usefulness of this wristlet.  Second, is the zipper buttons clang together when you walk and make a tinging, bell like sound.  Its a little annoying and its made worse by if you have a tendency to swing your arms or talk with your hands.  Finally, I'm not really sure what the symbols on the zippers mean...lol","Nice separate compartments, No credit card slots"

4,"The two previous reviewers said that this was not red, but did not say how they would describe the colour.  I really like the colour, and would describe it as rust or brick.  It's perfect for fall. The fabric feels like cotton, and something else, with some spandex.  ( I suspect the fabric content label is in Chinese).  It's quite a heavy knit and not suitable for summer wear.  I wear a size 16W and it just fits.  At 5 ft. 0"" it is dress length for me, but I'm going to wear it with leggings or tights and short boots. The shark bite hem is quite accentuated, but I'm hoping that it will fall closer to the side after washing.  The sleeves are very long and narrow at the cuff, but I can fix that.  The sewing lines are interesting, and the one pocket is in the middle, and will take some getting used to. I haven't washed it yet, but I will have to be careful, as fabric content is an unknown.

I ordered a large and it fit as expected -- semi-loose like on the model, but not baggy.

I wash them in cold water and dry them on a normal cycle.  They come out great.  I don't think they need cold water but I have started doing most laundry in cold water.

4,"We like silver jewelry more than gold.  The silver color contrasts better against natural skin tan and looks really nice.

The pendant looks very nice, and is just the right size for somebody who is petite size.  It has a nice elegant look to it.  The chain, however, gives the necklace a 'younger' look, as opposed to what somebody middle-aged would wear.  It is difficult to describe...As another reviewer mentioned, it's thin.  It does not look cheap, and seems to be strong, it just misses that extra substance to give it a more elegant, more mature look that would suit somebody middle-aged better.  Perhaps a slightly thicker chain with a different pattern can solve this.  Or, wear this to feel younger!  Convince yourself you are still in your late twenties or early thirties.  The chain does not need to be a show-stopper.","Nice necklace, 'young' look and feel"

4,"I like the dress, I ordered a medium, pretty much as expected. I think is because I am 82 of chest that the neck-shoulder part is larger that the photo reference. The long is great for me (1,64mts). I think that if I had ordered an small it would fit for chest-neck-shoulders but the long of the dress would be shorter, so I prefer to fix the neck instead of the long, that has no solution.",I like the dress

The medium is exactly what I wanted and although a small would have worked I'm thrilled with the choice I made and what I got.

Straps were passable, and no belt strap.  But it was handy to toss it on my back, especially given my wife's penchant for making me handle her bags as well.  Walking on the plane with a big backpack is way easier than rolling down the aisle.

4,"Right out of the box, the shoes felt super light, very unlike most Clarks (having owned a handful in the past). Th laces definitely pop but you get an extra pair in a dark grey. I was concerned about the see thru sole but it's not as noticeable and adds a nice casual touch to the boot. One thing to note is that the Amazon pics seem to suggest these are brown but the listing clearly shows these are Grey. Even in person they have a hint of brown but definitely not brown. On the plus side i can wear these with black pants w/out worrying about clashing.

The fit is true but a tiny bit narrower in the toes than I expected. Not a huge deal as there s a good chance they'll loosen a bit up with more use.

Overall they are a keeper and I would recommend them.",Modern twist to classic Clarks Chukka

4,"A good quality shirt, like most Robert Grahams. As an owner of about 45 R.G. shirts, I feel I've reached the point where I know what to expect, detail-wise given the shirt's list price. This one is no exception. At this price point you usually get a nice printed fabric; embroidery details on the front; embroidered silk lining the inside the cuffs and collar, and contrasting silk lining the inside of the sleeve placket. This shirt is no exception. Although rare at this price point, a woven-pattern, rather than printed fabric would have garnered the final star. It would have been nice of Amazon to have included a more thorough description of these features, and an additional photo of the sleeve lining--a feature I have particular interest in as sometimes it is merely a cheap looking contrasting poplin print. Additionally, it would be nice for Amazon to stock RG's shirts in XS, as they are available on the RG Website. As it is, I must spend a good bit of money on taking in the sides and shortening the hem if I want to wear the shirt un-tucked. Amazon's Prime Two-day delivery is as reliable as clockwork.","Great Value, Nice Shirt"

4,"I never spend anywhere near $100 for golf shoes. There are too many good options in the $40 - $60 range. However, I recently bought my first pair of Skechers casual shoes and I really like the look, (light) weight and comfort of them. Couple that with wanting to try a newer style of golf shoe that doesn't require replacing spikes; and I had to try these. So far so good.

The one thing to be aware of - and it's a big plus for me, personally - is that the front of the shoe is quite rounded around the toe area, almost clownish looking. As to its looks, that's personal taste. But that rounded feature adds to the overall comfort for me. For someone with narrow feet - I don't know.

Advice for buying shoes online, specifically these: I tried going by a Skechers store, but they did not carry any golf shoes. But because I had another pair of Skechers, I felt fairly confident in the sizing in order to buy them online. The result: they fit just fine.","Pricey, but a good, comfortable golf shoe."

4,"I wasn't sure how much I'd like these earrings when I ordered them because the jade didn't seem to have much color in the pictures.  Now that I see them in person, I like them a lot. They are a very pale green but also have subtle, milky, ""veining"" (for lack of a better word) in the stones that make them interesting and alters their appearance in different lights.  The gold hook and bezel add beauty and interest and set the stones off beautifully. I think these are designed very well with thoughtful accents that make them quite lovely!

There were no identifying tags with these earrings but, if you look very closely, the ear wires are engraved with ""PAJ 925 China"".  They were shipped in Amazon's padded, lined presentation box inside a black paperboard box and were well protected.  They also had tight plastic earnuts to secure the hooks to their black, padded card.  I found the best way to remove these was to twist them gently as you pulled them off the wires. You may still have to carefully straighten them a little.  The hooks are not small at a half inch wide and about an inch long.  The overall length of the earring is a little over one and a half inches, which to me is a perfect length.

I will enjoy wearing these with many different outfits.  Their subtle color coordinates better than a darker one, in this case.

4,"I should have gotten extra small.  Small usually fits me but this small hangs off me a little bit.  I love the color and the design.  I've been wanting a namaste tank with the om symbol so I am very happy about that. Also it is very comfortable and feels like I'm not really wearing a top.  However, the material is very thin and the bottom of the tank rolls up already.  I've bought two dollar tank tops at walmart that were thicker more durable material than this almost twenty dollar shirt.  It's beautiful but very cheap feeling and I wouldn't spend this much money on it again, but I'll keep it and hope it lasts longer than it seems it will.",Love the design but very thin and bottom rolls up

I had all my stuff arranged neatly and as soon as I went through airport security that arrangement was over. All pockets emptied.....now I'm trying to put stuff back in the pocket that I had it in, scrambling. I can feel the passport over on this side of the vest but after going through 3 pockets none of them lead to the passports, I can hear that I have pocket change but is is located in the pocket that leads just around my back area. etc. Just too much for me. I tried to be bag free but FOR ME. It's just easier to toss whatever is needed in a bag and keep a simpler vest for cash and really important stuff that I want to keep on me.

Unlike a typical costume boot, these are relatively comfortable as I've worn them around the house without any pain.  I have muscular calves and thighs and because these have functioning laces I was able to lace these up to exactly how tight/loose I needed them to be in certain areas.  I'd order these in your regular size as I found the foot bed fits normal, and you can adjust the tightness of the shaft of the boot (so you shouldn't have to adjust sizing for that part of the boot).",Surprisingly Comfortable

The box it came in was pretty worthless to me, but the watch itself is a great timekeeping device. I was curious about the magnifying front on it, and after examining it further, I've found it to be pretty cool. The white hands are very easy to see and track. My one complaint is that if the chain become disconnected from the clip, it is a nightmare to get back on, as you have to pull apart the metal to try to shove the thick link back into the loop.

It is pretty small when opened. I wanted one that was small when closed so I could easily carry it in my work bag or diaper bag. I really wanted one that was auto open and auto close because with a toddler, my hands are always full and by the time I can close an umbrella Im wetter than Id be without one! Finally, I wanted one that would repel the water so it didn't take forever to dry. This is one is small and seems to repel water well, but it just doesn't provide enough coverage in anything more than a small shower. Since I have had skin cancer in the past I am very careful in the sun. I think this will make the perfect sun umbrella! Im not sure Ill choose it over my others in a rain though!

Almost too big for everyday use. It would be a great diaper bag or travel bag. It comes with a removable shoulder strap which is great. It has several pockets, but they're quite large as well. A drop in bag organizer would be great for this. The quality is a little less that I would like. The canvas is very thin and the lining is this as well. I'm not sure how this bag would hold up to everyday use. I checked the stitching on it and it seems pretty sturdy. My favorite thing about this handbag is the color. I got the yellow and blue and I think it's absolutely gorgeous. My only worry about this bag is how well it will hold up over time, but I will update my review if needed. At this point, I would recommend this bag to anyone needing a larger than normal tote. This would definitely have you covered.","Very, very big....."

Instead, I received a mediocre dress, which is somewhat transparent, and will require me to purchase a black slip to wear underneath it.

4,"I love these shoes.  They are comfortable and they seem to breathe well.  I get hot easy and especially when it comes to shoes.  Ive worn them all summer and they have stayed pretty cool.  They appear to be great quality and look fantastic.  Every time we go out of town Ive looked in every store we come to trying to find the right loafer and I had a hard time finding one that has adequate amount of sole that looks good.  Many loafers are the sportier ones that have narrow soles that don't extend to the edge of the shoe (these make me nervous about turning an ankle!) or they have tremendously bulky soles that make them too heavy.  As you might tell, I'm really adverse to a lot of the styles they have out these days.  These are just right.  They have a good classic loafer feel and look with a modern touch without being overboard.  Also, I'm a yearlong sandal wearer and a huge reason why I bought these is to have something to wear on bad weather days that don't require boots.  These loafers hold up great!  I've put them through a lot of rain and mud so far and they seem to shed moderate amounts of both pretty well - of course, I wasn't stepping in anything that would submerge them either.  I gave it 4 stars because, even though the padding on the inside seems to fit with the foot and feels good, it doesn't have the best arch support - but honestly which loafer does?",I love these shoes
4,The product arrived in good condition. The material is pretty good quality but a little stiff and doesn't stretch a lot.  The size runs maybe two sizes too small.

Order was size because from the reviews it said to order a size up, but I regret listening to those reviews. I like that I have a bit of space, but I prefer a nice fitted shoe on my foot. The reason I gave it a 4 star was because the back of the shoe does rub on the back of your foot which will leave a blister so make sure to protect your feet during the first few  wears of the shoes. The reason I got blisters might be because the shoes are a bit big on my feet, but I just wanted to give a bit of warning cause blisters are not fun. Overall, happy with my purchase and it's perfect for standing on my feet all day.",Great Pair of Work Shoes

I was concerned that the fabric would be too shiny at first. In fact it has a very nice and subtle sheen to it. Unfortunately, I will have to return the item because:
1) I ordered size L. The slim body is a good fit for my husband but the sleeves are too slim relative to the body.  It fits OK over a very light sweater and shirt but your elbows would feel the pinch with a thicker sweater underneath.
2) The hood is perfect if you commute using public transportation and have to walk a few blocks on a cold day. However, it is somewhat bulky and does not zip out and therefore is not ideal if you mostly drive in your own vehicle.",In fact it has a very nice and subtle sheen to it

I have wide feet across my arch but my heels are boney and narrow. The only style of shoe that really works best for me is a mary jane. The strap keeps my foot from slipping out of the shoe. This shoe is well made - the leather is soft and supple and the strap is very sturdy. These shoes are cute enough to wear with a casual outfit and pretty enough to wear with my work dresses. It's a low heel and not totally flat and that makes a ton of difference in how the shoes looks with a dress My feet didn't hurt even at the end of the day which is a pleasant change for me. The strap is long enough to really adjust it if you need to and the velcro seems to be stronger than some of my other shoes with velcro closures.

The legs are supposed to be snug so I don't know if I can say if they are too tight or just right.  My son is 36lbs and has good sized legs. They are bordering on too tight but seem to be fine.

Also, I expected them to be bigger than 1"" x 1"".

4,"I bought these shoes over a year ago I believe, when I was first getting into mountain biking. They were a bit of overkill I would say for beginner shoes but they did the job pretty good. I've since moved on to road cycling but occasionally I still hit the trails and these shoes still are going strong. The only problem I would have with them is that the surface on which the cleats lie flat is very tacky, and if not set up correctly the cleats could damage the shoe. This happened to my shoes because I set up the cleats and pedals both extremely tight, and eventually the abrasive backing of the cleat began to chew through the sole of the foot when I would pull out of the pedal and the cleat would shift sideways. They are very breathable (almost too much for winter rides) and they will stand up to crashes. Size was a bit larger than expected.
Pro tip: Cleats set up snug, pedal tension set up loose! Never set up your pedals tighter than your cleats.",Good value for beginners
4,"I bought this for a baby shower gift for a friend. The fit is exactly what I expected. The picture is beautiful and very detailed. The fabric is soft and looks durable, I'm hoping that the screen-printed picture will hold up in the wash. I love that the tag attached looks like an old school library card.

I was worried reading the reviews before I bought it but its held up thus far.  I only hope it doesn't disappoint tomorrow after writing this review.  The stone is pretty and cut well.  It has a bit of a clarity issue.  Nothing shines like a real rock but for the price and the size, its lovely and I receive lots of compliments on it.",I like this ring
4,"I am 5'5"" and weigh 125 lbs. It fits me perfectly. BUT, if I had large arms it would not. After laundering the cuff measures 12"".
I washed it in cold water in a large mesh laundry bag , dried it for 15 min. on low (without the bag), and hung it to dry. It dries quickly and does not require ironing unless you want a crisper look.
I bought the blue and white pattern and love it. I would buy another but don't see another pattern I like.
I give only four stars for lack of washing instructions, no tags on garment, and difficulty in sizing.",Glad I took a chance
4,"I was looking for a small lightweight bag  that was small but not too small to cross hang while off shopping in my scooter knowing my purse isn't in the way out a distraction.

4,"Comfy and attractive shoe for the price.  The stacked heel makes them comfy to wear all day.  VERY weird smell to them.  Maybe glue??  I set them outside when I first got them.  After airing them out and wearing them out, I didn't notice the smell anymore.","Cute, comfry"

4,"I really like these shoes! They didn't have my size, but with some bulky socks I am determined to make them work because they are just my style. They seem solidly constructed for something that costs under $20 and as someone who doesn't care about name brands, only aesthetics, these shoes fit the part of fashionable tennis shoes that I would feel comfortable wearing to work (I work in a professional office). They don't look like I am going to the gym or I bought them from a tie dye factory.

They lose one star because I have really small feet and they did not offer my size, but it is hard to find small sizes often, so it's not a huge deal. Everything else is great!",You get more than you pay for!
4,"I've just got them! Arrived way faster than i expected.
They do look like in the picture. I was worrying whether they would suit me, cuz my face is not a small one. But they fit great! I only wish they got narrower nose bridge, so when i'm smiling they won't be on my cheeks (i always have such problem). And the glass surface seems scratch fragile (there is a tiny scratch already, dunno how i did it or it was there). But anyway, for the price i got them they are great:)",They do look like in the picture

4,"I needed a 'gold' color watch for the days that my jewelry falls on the gold side.  This fits the bill.  The face has a lovely, and I do mean lovely floral design around the edge where the numbers should be.  I miss the Indigo feature.  The reason I deducted a star is the 'pearl' face.  I cannot easily read the time.  Who thought that a pearl face was something that was going to make it less easier to read the time?? They need to go back to the drawing board and rethink that idea.  Keep the floral design though. The crystals are neither here nor there.  I have to wear a watch so this works.  It has the clasp on the back and the best that I can measure, it looks like about a 9"" opening with the clasp closed.  The face is a little on the larger size so if you are looking for something small, this is not for you.",Beautiful Floral design but pearl face is difficult to read

4,"It fits perfectly and does not cut you off, I wear a size 4-6 in jeans, 27W in shorts. I had to order a Large.

When it is dry it fits great, but getting in the water, it gets slouchy and since the sides are lace it doesn't hold onto you very well.

I should have ordered a Medium but I was in a time crunch and didn't get into water with them so I figured the Large was fine.

I'd have bought 10 of these (across the entire short-sleeve line) if it were only a little bit bigger. Alas. I'm still giving it four stars, as I don't think my manly bulk is the manufacturer's fault.

One note, though: The sleeves are a bit shorter than usual, and I doubt it has anything to do with my height. They fit as pictured, and it's a strange cut that I assume has something to do with current fashion.

My only concern is that the material does not seem like it will be very warm - the box was so light that I didn't believe it could possibly contain a coat.

I have used this bag for sometime & I have to change my review.  The bag needed time to get broken in.  The leather is still thin but has become much softer.  Pockets are still small.  I keep my cellphone in the rear zippered pocket which is large enough.  I use the small card pockets for folded coupons & folded shopping list.

4,"These sandals run a size small. I normally wear a size 9, but the 10 fits comfortably, and snug enough that they stay on the foot without binding. This is my second pair.

4,"I usually wear a small in NYDJ tops, and ordered the same size for this top, but the fit is simply too tight across the chest.  I wear a C cup and the sewn-in panel totally flattened my chest.  I ordered a medium in hopes of getting a better fit.  It's a nice shirt, well made though.

Thought I'd give an update on the medium that I ordered. The problem with this shirt is the ""slimming"" panel; it feels constricting, uncomfortable and flattens your chest. It simply adds an unnecessary layer to the shirt.  A clever idea, but not well-executed. I like the shirt enough to keep it, but I'm going to remove the slimming panel.","Tight across chest, order one size up"

I bought it in hopes of wearing it to a wedding, but was unable due to the baggy underarms and will be sending it back. From under the bust line up should be rouched or cinched to be more true to size. The waist and down fit right though.

The bag has two main zippered sections, three smaller outside zippered pockets, two inside ditto and three open slot-type pockets outside. It is large and holds everything I need to carry with me--and that's a lot! Though not a true navy, the color is okay and actually does match the shoes I usually wear with it (which were advertised as ""indigo""). My reservations are based mainly on the fact that the pockets are lined, not with fabric but with a crinkly plastic--obviously to reduce cost--which is noisy and doesn't look like it will wear at all well. While I don't like that feature, I did like the price.",Love the huge number of pockets!

Furthermore, ordering my normal Sanita size was quite small and narrow.  I can see my toes through the rubber wearing normal socks.  I'm keeping them because I plan to wear them mostly to walk the dog for 20 minutes at a time, and don't want to pay the $$ for the next size up (a pricing mystery).  3 stars.

UPDATE 2/3/16:  I've had these for a while and am upgrading to 4 stars.  They seem to have softened a bit (or my feet have just gotten used to them).  They hold water well, which is what they are supposed to do.  They are NOT warm if you are standing around shoveling 8"" of snow, but that's what snow boots are for.","Small, not like their clogs."

When I received it, and tried it on it fit very well around my belly area, enough room- but a little larger in the breast area, (I'm only a c cup.) I decided I wanted to wear a bra underneath but since it was a halter top, I knew the straps would show.. So I decided to cut the halter lace part in the back and sew the two pieces to the back of the lingerie.. It looked 100x better. I wore it when I went to visit my husband & he enjoyed it.

The lobster clasp is large and sturdy making it very easy to manipulate, and the satin finish complements the braided leather very well.  The only issue I've run into is that the hoop section of the clasp (which is hooked by the lobster claw on the other end) is large and it's a bit difficult to find pendants with eyelets large enough to use.

I'm 5'2"" 120lbs and ordered medium as I wanted it to be slightly over sized. It was perfectly over sized but if the length was any shorter (like if I ordered a small) it would look like high waters so I don't recommend for tall people. The buttons are about 6 inches apart so when I wore it on Halloween I had to wear legging and a cami underneath which I didn't mind because it was cold that night!!

4,"This was my second pair of shoes from Calden. The shoes are lightweight and are well made. I have not had them long enough to speak to the quality of this particular pair. (my other pair is Awesome!)  I would not recommend buying these as your first pair of lifts. I would recommend starting with 3 inches or less, then moving up. If you do this not only is your height increase not as drastic, it gives you time to learn to walk in elevator shoes. Once you learn they are great! I have flat feet and as I hit middle age started having back and Sciatic nerve problems. Wearing the shoes helps prevent that The shoes give me an arch so that I naturally stand up straight now rather than naturally slumping forward and slouching.

This jacket has a faux fur lining which is soft and comfy.  The jacket exterior is reminiscent of Carhartt or Dickies, I think it's made of cotton canvas?

There are various leather/faux leather elements on the coat- on the shoulders and top of the breast pocket.

The pockets are purely for show.  Although the waist pockets have flaps and buttons they are purely cosmetic.  The breast ""pocket"" isn't even a pocket, the button is sewn on and you can't even lift the flap.  The other breast pocket/zipper pocket can be unzipped and zipped but there is no pocket inside.  I really don't get why companies do this.  Would it have killed them to put in actual pockets?  Come on.  It's especially noticeable since this is a WINTER coat and you have no place to keep your hands warm.

The style is awesome though, I love the asymmetrical design of the breast ""pockets"" and the dark tan color is great.  I just wish it had real pockets.",Runs very small

4,These are beautiful cufflinks. The detailing is nicely done and they are exactly like the picture. The product also comes with a small cleaning cloth.

4,I got waist size 31 and they fit me. I've got kinda thicker legs and they are kinda tight on my legs. Definitely would look good on someone with skinnier or less thick legs so they have room to move around. Not bad though. They are pretty short! Which is why I got them so that's a plus. Definitely for a skinnier legged man though.,Not bad

4,"The strap feels great, arrived fast and fit the watch very well. The Only critique I can give is that the color of the strap is slightly off.  The Bentley Tan in the amazon pic looks like a Camel light tan and what you get is more like a Honey Beige. The leather feels great and was very please at how it looked on my watch. Thanks and I do recommend this strap.",Great Strap color correction
4,"I want to like it.
I like the texture, color, construction.
It's good all around.
Except one problem.
I bought it to wear with my white pants... and it bleeds some color onto the fabric of the pants :(...
Not everywhere, but in the front. I think probably in the place, where the painted face of the belt touches pants when you sit down.
Will see how it goes over time. But one day at works and there's a faint blue line underneath the belt.
I'm getting a bit tired. this is second blue belt of a different manufacturer. The first one was leaving distinct black marks, when edge of the belt touched even slightly fabric of the pants.","Great belt, but a little problem"

4,"This is a beautifully made jumpsuit.  I typically wear a size 2X in Karen Kane plus size clothing, and the top portion of this suit fit perfectly.  It would make an adorable top.  However, the bottom portion of the jumpsuit was too big.  If you carry most of your plus-size in your chest, stomach and hips (as I do), but have average sized or thinner legs, it kind of swallows your lower half.  I would try going down to a size 1X, but then I think the bust portion would be too tight.  Otherwise, I really wanted to keep this because it is so nice and versatile, but I don't want baggy pants!  I'm 5'6"" and the length was perfect on me.","Beautiful, stylish, top fits like a glove, but pants were too baggy"

I wish they came with two of each because i have both my ears pierced but I just switched them around a bit so that they are black in the front and i screw the silver one to the back so i can have two earrings of the same size with the front black and the back silver. They have held up very well and i wear them always. At one point one side fell off of one of them but i just screwed it back in and it was fine.,I love these earrings

4,"I received these Friday June 8th, it's now July 13th.  Usually I wear a size 7.5 but for these I ordered a 7, they fit perfectly. They were heavy for the first week, and a little uncomfortable. After braking them in they are by far my most comfortable shoe. My back, feet, and legs were killing me. Since wearing these this has helped with that a lot. My feet do start to hurt by the 8 hour mark but I am on my feet all day. I wear them 6 days a week 9-18 hours a day, and they are super comfortable and durable. I highly recommend these shoes, and the shoe care kit.

However, the only issue I have is one of the shoes was cracked and peeling prior to wearing them. And now that I've worn them a while it's pretty much peeled completely. The heal part has started to rip as well. I would recommend getting 2 pairs so you can alternate. Overall I absolutely love these and would purchase again.

My only complaint is that the latch feels a little flimsy, but it's not loose. The quality is great for the price.

Just a note, the pillows that hold the watches fit loosely inside the spaces (so there is room for the watch bands). I would recommend keeping the box upright or putting a bit of double sided tape under each pillow if you are giving this as a gift, just so it looks nice when they open it and the little pillows aren't all askew.","Wonderful gift, great quality"

I wish the insoles had a bump for my high arches however (-1 star). My teen finds them cool enough to wear too. Some LaPlume styles are grandmotherly. We got a white pair and a cream pair. Both are nice. Should have goten black - they would last longer. They are nice to go to the store or BBQ but I wouldnt use them for a beach (all leather), nor for heavy hiking.

I used to always wear a narrow shoe, but as time went on, now buy mostly mediums. These are a good fit.  If your feet are a wider medium, I don't think they would feel good.  I doubt these can be stretched, so I'm happy with the fit as they are.  I also purchased the snake print and beige colors.  Looking forward to updating some outfits with their look.

A little crisper than I'd prefer, but this is meant to be a windbreaker so keep that in mind. Love the hood- great for sudden sprinkles. But I wouldn't take this out in the middle of a storm, expecting to stay dry. Cute enough to be a gym-to-grocery store type article of clothing.

Material is a lot more durable and thick than I was expecting, which seems to suggest a long life span. However, saw some loose threading and some funny material around the ""horns"" which I'm hoping won't be an issue later on. The zipper clasp at the bottom is a bit thin so it took some patience to hook and zip up, but again, hoping that won't be an issue in functionality in the long run. I was not expecting the Hoodie to have eye views...its literally going over your face like the mask and is awesome..except for that fit...but the cool factor overrides it for me. I like fitted so I'll try to get past that...but any DD fan is going to LOVE the novelty of this hoodie...","saw some loose threading and some funny material around the ""horns"" which I'm hoping won't be ..."

I can easily wear them over jeans, but on bare legs, they'd probably slide down. Good thing they look okay scrunched. A plus side: the material is fabric; not suede, so it can be tightened by stitching. Probably. I wore them with skinny jeans, and they fit pretty well. They're nice.","Big thighs, don't shy away!"

4,"I had nearly given up the search for wide hiking shoes in a cute color.  Apparently the shoe manufacturers think that if you have a hobbit foot, you should be ashamed and wear only dull ugly colors so that you don't draw attention to yourself.  Screw that, I say.  I want shoes in a pretty color.  Well, I found reviews on these complaining that they were too wide, which alerted me to the possibility that they may be suitable for my foot even though they are not labeled wide.  I'm a 9.5D and found the shoes true to length and fit my width too.  Narrow-footed freaks will not be happy, but they have tons of other cute shoes to choose from.

Aside from the width issue, they were very comfortable right out of the box.  No blisters.  I wore them all day and felt comfortable.  They repel water and have excellent traction.  Reasonably lightweight also.  If you're a wide-footed hiker, BUY.

4,"These are my nth pair of Fidji shoes. This pair is probably my least favorite, but that's because all the others have been exceptionally stylish AND comfortable. Even with that, I still choose them over some other brand. These shoes are pretty - the tapered toe is fabulous and the two-toned leather and detailing add some really nice visual interest. I've come to expect this from Fidji. Now, the con. These shoes are really hard to put on! Half a dozen wears in, it's still a struggle and I still have to wiggle my feet quite a bit to get in them. I think that tells me I need to get a shoe horn. The first time I wore them, they felt very tight but loosened up and were somewhat comfortable by the end of the day (for context, I use mass transit and do a fair amount of walking). I'm hoping that with time, they will continue to loosen up. Also, heads up - that zipper is not functional; it's just decoration. It's a nice touch, but be aware that you won't be able to unzip and ease your foot in. The opening that you see is all there is, but the elastic gusset on the inside helps with that. Also, be forewarned that Fidji shoe size 42 = size 11M US (not size 12 as the chart says). I have several pairs of Fidjis and this sizing is consistent.",Lovely but a bit hard to put on

4,"I bought this shirt for my son who spends 2-3 hours daily at the gym lifting.  The graphic on the front is well done and seems to entirely define what he spends most of that gym time doing.

The shirt is well constructed of a soft, pre-washed, 100% cotton knit with quality graphics that are done in the United States.  It launders nicely and hasn't shrunk since it was prewashed.  I bought it in the green color which turned out to be the shade I was hoping for -- a true green without being overly vivid or bright.  It arrived nicely folded inside its own canvas bag which was a nice touch.","Fun weightlifting T-shirt --  ""I lift things up and put them down"""

PROS:
Black
Breathable fabric
Fits a medium head well and I have a lot of thick hair (not sure it'll fit any larger than medium)
I feel this would keep your face warmer in all those winter sports but also if it's a chilly let's be a ninja night

CONS:
After a short period of wearing it indoors in air conditioning as a test, I did start to get heated in it. So yeah, only wear it on very chilly nights like when there's potential for frozen cheeks and lips lol

*** see photos---- Not sure why Amazon is now inserting photos sideways and upside down - that's not how I took them - sorry.

4,"This is well designed for its purpose and well made. Strong, durable but light material, easy to clean, doesn't hold wrinkles after wash, doesn't shrink. Seams are tight.

The medium size is longer than I expected, given the 31"" inseam. The inseam measure is accurate, but when I wear the pants at the level that feels right, the crotch is low, adding an inch or two to the length. These fit like 33"" inseam jeans on me. Put another way--these things have a high waist, if you want to wear them that way. The waist size is perfect for my 33"" waist, with ample elastic, a drawstring I don't need, and belt loops if you prefer that.

The care instruction symbols on the tag mean this is machine washable in hot water (up to 140 degrees F, 60 C), no bleach, tumble dry normal (medium heat), iron (if needed) on low heat.","Quality work wear, care instructions"

I was very surprised when they arrived and were clearly almost a size too big.  However, this vendor took the boots back and refunded my money very quickly, and I reordered a size smaller, which arrived very fast.  As with any Dolce Vita boots I have purchased, these are very cute, are as comfortable considering the heel height, and very stylish.

4,"First off, not sure why folks are giving this product 1 star. The product description clearly says that these are I2/I3 clarity. On each stone, there is a small inclusion that you can see with the naked eye. I guess that would be a deal breaker if it was on an engagement ring... However no one is going to be staring into my ears with a loupe. That said, the size is very nice- not too big and gaudy where people think you have cz on and not so small that you have to squint to see it. And they are sparkly other than that. Looks very nice in the light. Good buy- but it gets 4 stars because the description says screw back and the pictures are push back- and I assumed that the product write up would be what was sent. I will have to go to the jewelry store to have them change them to screw  backs so they don't fall off by accident.",Good buy and very nice size

4,"I have a feeling a lot of people simply don't know what size they wear. I got swayed by reviewers saying that the American sizes run small, so I ordered an American large when I normally wear medium for form fitting and large for baggy t-shirts. The vest was absolutely baggy on me.  I had to tighten it with the included waist straps. Looks pretty great now, though it is still baggy around the arm holes. I'm thinking a medium would be a perfect fit, so I may order another. If I had not read the reviews, this is exactly what I would have expected the size to be. Think of the size more like a boxy button up shirt, not an athletic cut t-shirt. Some stores like Wal-Mart tend to run very big on their sizes. I buy my clothes at The Gap and Target. if anything, this runs slightly larger at the chest than those stores.

For $25, this is a really nice vest. I ordered the thick black and it definitely seems like more of a khaki style material than denim. Honestly, I prefer it to denim. I'll ding it a star for the description not matching up in that respect though. Not very thick, but in a good way!

Black is the kind of material that really attracts lint and hair. I'm thinking I'll go for a medium in another color, because I've got long hair cats and usually stay away from this kind of material because it is the kind that even lint rollers have trouble grabbing hair off of.",Trust the American sizes!

I enjoy dressing up on weekends and creeping out anyone who may knock on my door. This Vampire Kigurumi does the job admirably. It is made by Sazac and as such, is high quality. It's warm and comfy and gives you an air of unbridled confidence when you wear it. You pretty much feel like the Count from Sesame Street as you lie motionless on your daybed, waiting until the midnight hour to slowly rise and eat Kraft Dinner leftovers. You also have the curious compulsion to enumerate things around the house in a vaguely Romanian accent. So that's a plus.

The charms themselves are made from a pretty solid and heavy metal.

Aside from that it is a very solid item happy with purchase.,I have to admit they are nice they shipped almost immediately and arrived earlier than expected

4,"I have had this watch for 3 days, and it took me this long to decide if I love or hate this watch. I really like the color, which is actually a much darker, true beige-khaki than appears in the photo, and the monochromatic look, with every party of the watch the exact same color, really makes it stand out! The numbers on the face are very large and easy to read, despite being only slightly lighter in tone than the watch face itself. The watch feels very solid and well built, so hopefully it'll withstand some hard wear and tear.

My only warning is that this thing is MUCH bigger than i realized! I took note of the measurements, but it's still overall bigger than i expected. And the case is very thick so it sits high off my wrist. The product photo showing the watch on an arm is definitely not accurate because the whole bezel and casing is bigger than my wrist and I do not have small wrists!

Overall I have decided that I love the watch and have already received several compliments. It just wasn't quite what i was expecting.

Cheers!","Great retro style swim watch, but HUGE"

I wear a lot of high heels shoes and it can be super annoying to listen to the clicking all day long especially when walking in quiet areas. The protectors didn't eliminate the clicking completely, however they did reduce it noticeably, so I would recommend for this purpose. Much cheaper than having to replace the caps. I didn't have problem putting them on the heels. They fit snug and didn't fall off with walking.
The heels of my shoes look little different with these on (wider on the bottom) but I wear them with pants so it didn't bother me at all, plus black caps with black shoes are barely noticeable. Overall, I would recommend. I'm sure they will not last forever and will need to be replaced but even a few months of wear is worth it.",Serves the purpose

4,"1.  Quality (4 of 5 stars)

Oakley lenses really do live up to their reputation.  Clarity is definitely above average, and distortion is non-existent.  I tried these on at a store, and I was pretty satisfied with everything, except the color of the lenses.  These come with light grey lenses, allowing your eyes to be shown through them.  Now I know this sounds like a style issue, but they are rated at 39% light transmission. I have to note that I purchased a custom made version of these glasses with Black Iridium Polarized lenses (rated at 9% light transmission).  With the Black Iridium lenses, I feel they do an adequate job of blocking out direct sunlight.  So that makes me question if light grey lenses at 39% light transmission would do the job or not.

Frame is made of ""O-matter"" (whatever that means).  To me, it's just sturdy plastic.  That's not to say it's a negative aspect, it's just probably their fancy way of saying plastic.  To me the frame seems like it will hold up to stresses and won't be breaking anytime soon.

2.  Comfort (3.75 of 5 stars)

All the issues associated with the facial characteristics of an Asian anatomy seem to have been addressed with this pair.  I struggled to find a pair of sunglasses that would comfortably fit my head/face.  The stems wrap nicely around my temples, and there is only the slightest indention on my temples when I take them off.  I only have a small issue with the bridge.  Since I have no nose bridge, only the bottom portion of the nose bridge rests on the ""beginning"" of my nose.  Oddly, everything still stays in place and they don't slide down my nose.

3.  Style (2 of 5 stars)

To me, majority of Oakley styling is too flashy.  As I said previously, I did purchase a custom made version of this model, only because I value function over form.  To be blunt, I don't like Oakley designs.  I do find the squarish lens design to be absolutely cool.  My 2 biggest gripes about this pair is the pointed nose and the accented stems.  But it just goes to show how much I like these sunglasses to wear something I feel isn't all that pretty.

So the average score comes out to 3.25 of 5 stars.  Based on Amazon's rating system, this equates to ""a little better than OK"".  Although this model has its flaws, I can proudly say that this pair was, and will remain, my first pair of sunglasses.

As of writing this review, the only seller seems to be Motorhelmets Motorcyle Accessories with an excellent price of $153 (10% below retail).

* Note, I highly recommend you try these on at a retail location in order to get a feel for the light grey lenses.",Content with this pair

This bag is fantastic, because it's light weight and has organization for credit cards and cash. This lightens the weight further, since I no longer have to carry a wallet. The pimento color on my screen appears to be a bit deeper online than how it appears in person. In person, this bag is a pinkish orange color, close to a salmon tone. It's a beautiful color, and I am sure I will get a lot of use out of this bag during the spring and summer.",Great organization in a light weight cross-body bag

Smelled a little stale smelling so running it in dryer with just air and fabric softener sheets. Also, not a ton of filler on this version (chest zipper version). Originally ordered version without that looks puffier in pics but out of stock. Anyway, no regrets. Fits great on all measures.

Updated 02-02-15: While I love the coat, fit, length, cut... I am disappointed that I'll have to take it in for repair so soon after the recent purchase. The button/pocket clips (backing) on both hip level outer pockets pulled through the fabric. There isn't proper backing/support to the button clips and now worried about all of the clips down the front. :-( I should possibly downgrade from 4* but will leave.",Great fit. Trust chart.

When i tried to close the gap on the hook, it broke. Amazon replaced it with a new one.

My feet are slightly wide and because of the make of this sneaker, the top lip hugs you tight so I'm glad I kept the half size up. What I love most about these, this is the first sneaker in this style that considered more support in your heel. We all know and fear the breaking in period of flats, blisters later, but this sneaker has extra soft padding in the heel and it makes them so comfortable. Granted you still need to break these in, it was much less painful as others in this category.",Most comfortable flat

4,"I was absolutely terrified about buying a dress online. I measured myself and then went and got measured just to be sure of my size. I ordered a size bigger as I read some of the reviews saying the bust part was a bit snug. The seller contacted me and asked for my measurements, which was a nice surprise! I ordered the dress June 3rd, that night I got the email requesting my measurements. I received the dress today, June 20th, which was amazingly fast!!
The little bag it came in is perfect for storing the dress. I ordered it in white. It needs to be taken in about 2 inches but that's okay! It falls just under my knees which is the length I wanted. I love the fact that the tie in the back isn't attached because I plan on finding a red sash to add some color (for my wedding).
I really liked the way the bow looked in the picture and the other review pictures, but it just did not look right on me. I'm thinking because of how big my breasts are, it was just too much. It was easy to remove.

The strap does velcro over the foot but for my foot the strap is too long so I barely have the velcro attached. The toe box is wide but short. The top (not tip, top) of my big toe starts to feel pressure after a few hours.
I am keeping the shoe and will continue to wear them but will just be careful with the strap.",cute
4,I love these boots! I wear them daily and have had them for several months now. I use them for work so I did put a high quality insole arch support in them which made them alittle tight at first but they fit perfectly now. The only issue I have had otherwise is the leather strips are peeling off the heel but is easily glued back into place.,Love them!!

This bag is spacious, large enough to hold paperwork and laptop, made of good quality leather that you expect from the Coach brand. My daughter really likes this bag. Her only compliant is that it does not have a handle across the top, can not carry by hand. Will always have to throw over shoulder or across body.

4,"This looks great!  Colors and graphics are wonderful.  Generally well-made, although there were a number of long threads from the stitching, but all the hems were strong.  Only one problem: the size.  We have a two month old who just measured in the 60th percentile in length and he barely fits in the sixth month size now.  He's also a pretty skinny baby, so widthwise it fits him fine.  But by the time Xmas gets here, he will be way too long for it.  There is no 9 month, so we are returning it and are going to try the 12 month.  If you are planning on ordering and your baby is even average size for their age, plan on getting at least one size larger.","Amazing look, sizing runs very small."

I ordered a medium and it would be tight if I wore a sweater or anything with bulk to it.  It's tight in the chest area.  Other then that I will keep it.

I bought it for an outdoor music festival in June (and I may update this review after that).  So far, backyard pool reading is much more comfortable and it works as advertised.  In my opinion, it could be improved upon if there was some sort of solar power storage cell and an on/off button. The noise of the fan isn't loud, but its a bit distracting on partly cloudy days going on and off a lot.  Otherwise, BRAVO on this cool design.",Very cool hat!

4,"Do yourself a favor and read the measurements provided by the seller. I read all the other reviews of the dresses from this seller and was so worried about the dress being huge that I ordered my daughter's dress according to her age (5) and it won't even zip up the back. I ordered Elsa's coronation dress in the size she wears (6) and it barely fits, but I also ordered the Anna Frozen Fever dress in a 6 and it's perfect. I would suggest taking the time to measure your child and ordering accordingly, even if it seems like it might be too big or too small.

As far as the construction is concerned, this dress is beautiful. It's not itchy, it looks authentic and the necklace is a nice touch. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the detailing on the skirt sticks to itself so the skirt never really lays correctly, but it's certainly good enough for play time.","Sizing is inconsistent, measure your child before ordering"

4,"This mask was way too small - smashed my nose and eyes.  However, I spent about 2 hours doctoring it and the result was amazing.  I cut the seam that surrounds the face (where the fake stiching is), then used a heavy needle to puncture and thread it with leather laces that I bought at a craft store (going over where the fake lacing is).  Lacing it loosely allowed the mask to fit and didn't detract from it at all since the point is that Leatherface is wearing a pieces of other faces that are poorly sewn together.  I also cut off the lips and teeth since they're unnecessary and super glued a couple of large bent paper clips to the back of the mouth hole.  Since I'd already spent time making it look good, I cut a small bit of my own hair and super glued it over the eyebrows.  It was messy, but looked creepy afterward.",I spent about 2 hours doctoring it and the result was amazing. I cut the seam that surrounds the face ...

4,"This is a well organized travel bag. There are compartments and holders for just about anything small you need to keep with you or get to easily. I traveled overseas for a week, and had room for gum, keys, tablet, power adapters, headphones and a few packs of smokes. Note it does really hold all that but gets a tad bulky. Only downside was the shoulder / belt strap was too short to be used as a sling so i constantly had to re-position on my shoulder. If you wear across the shoulder, it sits too high to be comfortable.",Nice travel bag
4,It's a good backpack. Tons of pockets. Much bigger than I expected. I should have looked a little more closely at the dimensions. The metal hardware that is used to change the strap length isn't very effective. I have to tighten the straps almost every day.,It's a good backpack. Tons of pockets

4,"Surprised at the fit. Comfortable, stylish, and the heel is not too high.","Thought I wouldn't like shoes, BUT"
4,"What I mean by this is that, at first I was scared heckless (sorrynotsorry) that it won't fit because I tried it on right after it came in, knowing that I don't really focus on sock size or whatever, at first the whole thing didn't slide in only because I tried to slip/pull it right on, turns out I had to pull it on with my hands up to my ankles, feels comfortable, some stringy-feelings inside here and there, not so itchy or anything but, it's good.",Not your typical slip on easy socks
4,"Exactly the style I have been looking for with the side snaps. The size is what I usually order and it is just a bit on the loose side, which is better than too tight. If I were to have a complaint, it is that it seems to be starched to almost excess so it is a bit hard to break in. Other than that I really like it. It is well constructed and should last a long time for very little cost.",Good value for the price

4,"Full disclosure, I received this bag free in exchange for an honest review.

Overall, the bag seems well designed. The material is holding up very well, and seems like it will last quite a while. The size of the bag itself is perfect for a laptop and a few other items, books or otherwise. The straps are comfortable, and I've carried the bag for a few hours straight with no real soreness in my neck or back. The one issue I've had with the bag is that the zippers have tended to stick so far. Oftentimes they will only zip part of the way and then get stuck, after which they are almost impossible to close. It isn't that big of a deal, because the flap has a velcro connector, but it's an irritating flaw some of the time.","Good, sturdy bag, with one real snag."

4,"Looks nice, just a little bit small",Four Stars
4,"This is a very attractive charm. It is tiny but sparkly.  My only complaint about this (and this is the norm for many nice pendants) is that the chain is just okay. I don't have an issue with chains that have that o-ring type of clasp, but I would like to be able to change out the chain which is nearly impossible with this style of pendant. There are no loops or a bail on this. The chain goes right through the pendant itself. I have several 1.5 mm chains, but I hate them all, so I will just keep the chain from this charm. I'd actually like to find a way to wear this as a brooch, as it is so pretty. The small size is perfect for a light touch of style or for a child who will be attending a special occasion.",My only complaint is the chain
4,"Purchased these for my 12 mo old granddaughter, adorable first soft sole shoes.  They fit well, and stay on well.",So Cute!

As for the shoes they are always the most durable and hold up well to a kid who is rough on shoes.,Love the shoes hate the laces

4,"I got this to replace a similar wheeled briefcase that was showing its age. The edges had started to fray after about four years of constant use, sliding it down concrete steps, dragging it through snow and ice. Then the zipper on the front pocket wouldn't close any more and I decided I had gotten my money's worth from it. I like this updated model. It is well constructed, the wheels won't self destruct as some say they do on other models. i can carry everything I need and then some. The older one had a bit more room and more places to stash small items, but then I tend to carry too much junk with me. The section for documents could be a bit larger to allow carrying more files. And I've noticed that when it is really loaded, the handle's first and second sections deploy just fine, but I have to struggle to get the third section to extend. I never had that problem with the old one. I look forward to several years of service from it and will  likely replace it with another Samsonite case. It would be a welcome addition if it had a shoulder strap that could be used when the snow is too deep or there is standing water in the parking lot so I could sling it over my shoulder. I liked the handle on the old one better as it arched up slightly in the middle and was easy to grasp. This one lays flat on the top of the case and is a little harder to grab in a hurry. Overall I would recommend this rolling case and have no regrets about buying it after about seven weeks.","Plenty of room, rolls easily, handle difficult to extend fully if really loaded down."

4,"This watchband is really great.

For one thing, it looks even better in person than it does in pictures.  I have it on an Asus Zenwatch, and it looks much better than the stock band.

The quick release spring bars are great.  Since I have two bands with these bars, I can change bands in less than a minute with no tools.  This gives me the ability to switch from the casual/sporty look of this band to my more formal tan leather band very easily.

The quality of the leather is good.  I mean, this is a $20 band (with shipping), so don't expect premium quality leather, but the leather is on par with bands that cost $30-$50 in my opinion.

There is only one thing I would change, and that would be the clasp.  I strongly prefer a deployment or butterfly clasp to a traditional clasp, and the clasp on this watch does not appear to be replaceable, unlike several of my other bands where I have replaced the clasps.  This is the only reason this isn't a 5 star review.",An overall excelent and stylish band.

4,"After months of research on this type of jewelry storage, I finally chose this one. I took a chance because there was only one review. I liked it because I had the choice of using it with the stand, over the door or on the wall. I chose to hang it. Now that it's installed, I just love it. The box itself arrived packaged really well and came in perfect condition. The glass is real and does not distort the image in the reflection. I like having the lock there, although I will say that it somebody wanted to break into it, they could do it easily. Sometimes you just want to lock it though. It has so many hooks for bracelets and necklaces. I use the ring slots for my post earrings too and that works well. There are even small drawers for my watches, although these are very flimsy, almost made of velvet covered cardboard or something like that. Everything is organized exactly the way I want it and I'm so glad I bought it. There are just a few negatives but they are minor. The flimsy drawers, but just putting s few piece of jewelry in those should not break them. Also, on the door hooks opposite the drawers, you can only put very small pieces of jewelry or the door won't close. I was able to just put those necklaces on different hooks. That was no problem for me. But the most difficult part was installing this on the wall because the hardware that they provide is completely insufficient. Just two small screws on the top and you're done, but then when you open the door, sometimes it rocks left and right because there's no support on the bottom. That scratched the wall. We had to run to Home Depot and get supports for the bottom. Now that the installation is complete, I will say that for me it was worth it because I do love this box.",I liked it because I had the choice of using it ...

5,"It feels good to finally own a pair of pink boots for men! And at a very decent price as well! As a guy who is not only obsessed with the color pink but wears it pretty much daily, I can tell you how tough it is to find pink boots for men. So when I saw these at a decent price I HAD to go for them. It was either that or spend about 5 times the price for custom made ones. I was very surprised to see that from the very shoe box to the inside of the shoe is decorated with the color pink and the symbol of breast cancer awareness, something I will always support. The size I got fits me like a glove and I can't wait to wear these in public to show the world that men can style in pink just as much as the ladies! Get these if you love pink and/or support breast cancer awareness!","Love them, love them, LOVE THEM!"

5,"So, I'm still pregnant and can't talk about how nursing with it works, however . . . I have swollen to a 36H during this pregnancy and decided to splurge and get sports bras an regular bras to get through this and into the nursing stage, but they are SO structured that I really wanted something a little more chill. While technically the bras didn't go as big as I am currently, I had a feeling it would work out and it did.

And why did I get this? Because I have a box of disposable Bamboobies staring at me each day telling me abou tthe Braaaaaaaaaaaaah. And I kept thinking, I need this. When I am walking around the house nursing or I'm in labor, I just want that feeling instead of either strapped down or totally hanging out.

And I put this on and I went, ""BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.""

Can I go around all day in this? Well, I work from home, so yes. But not in public and don't intend to because of the thin material and lack of support for my size. But will I LIVE in this thing forever and ever like a pair of comfy pajamas, YES I WILL.

I've got pretty much the whole line of Bamboobie products (for good reason) and I'm so loyal. I also love that they invariably come with a free goodie like a nursing pad set or what not. It's so much value, and I feel so much love from the company for what they do. So, yes all around from me!",This is my go-to casual or night bra!

5,"This is a keeper!  The text in the listing body says that it is a racerback style tank top, but it isn't... it has a regular back. The pictures clearly show that, and we picked it because it has a standard back. We were not disappointed. Very nice top; fits great, looks good and is very comfortable. Says that it is a 'cotton blend' and it does have a little bit of stretch to it, so cotton and... spandex? Not sure, but do really like it and would recommend to others.

Another great item from ACEVOG that looks just like the pictures (we received the Sky Blue top) in the listing. I am about 5 feet 5 inches tall and slim, usually wearing a 4 or 6 US, while our daughter is about the same height and a lot more curvy. The fit of the Medium is perfect for me and perfectly snug for her, which her boyfriend says that he likes... hmmmm. We both agreed it is cute.

The tag does not provide information on care but the Amazon listing confirms hand wash (lay flat to dry) or dry clean.

No mention of a warranty, so if an issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this item gratis from the seller and I have worn it to objectively find out how well it looks and wears. My statements here reflect that testing.

If you are looking for a top of this size, style, price, construction and color, then I would highly recommend giving this top from ACEVOG a try based on our experience with it. Very cute and sexy.

Very recommended.

5,"What a beautiful watch this is!  It has all the features I wanted: anti reflective sapphire crystal, Swiss movement, mother of pearl dial, 330 feet water resistance  AND an extremely well crafted time piece.  The watch band was easy for me to size myself: I needed to remove five links, but was able to quickly do so with my watch repair kit purchased on Amazon for about ten dollars.  The watch is solid and substantial, but not too heavy and the case isn't as thick as most Invicta watches, so it lays comfortably on my wrist.  The cz bezel looks just like diamonds, as the stones are equivalent in size to two point diamonds, which is what would be found on a high end watch costing thousands of dollars.  this looks and feels like a very expensive watch, plus everything except the 'diamonds' is exactly what would be found on such a watch, except that it wasn't hand assembled in Switzerland.  Frankly, I would rather have the look and feel than the extravagant price tag, which is why this watch is exactly what I had hoped it would be.  Five BIG stars for this one!",Pretty in Pink

If you love comfy clothes, you are missing out if you don't own a pair.

Size: Rating 5/5
I ordered an XL as I like clothing to be loose. Both the hoodie and the shorts fit perfectly as Juniors US sizing.  The hoodie has a nice length which allows it to extend down over the top of the shorts. You can raise your arms without worry that your stomach will be exposed. The shorts are comparable to a gym short length. They provide ample coverage in the behind so that you can comfortably bend over.

Fabric: Rating 5/5
Soft & Luxurious Plush Fleece does not begin to explain the exquisite feel of these pajamas. Very much like a constant hug from a baby blanket or being surrounded by a huge teddy bear. The fabric brushes your skin with devine touch and softness.  Both the hoodie and shorts are made of the same material. Inside and out exhibit this fine softness.

Make: Rating 5/5
Very well made with care and attention to detail.  The seams are nicely gathered and sewn straight and consistent. All edges are nicely formed and rounded. There are no hanging threads or pulls to come apart.

Washing: Rating 5/5
I tried the set on prior to wash to get a feel of the fit.  I washed in a normal medium wash with detergent and fabric softener. Dried completely in the dryer. The fit after wash/dry was just as was prior. No shrinking or defective wear after.  The fabric looked just as nice after the items were washed/dried.  No ironing was required.

Additional Info:
I was initially attracted to the pink the color. It is a very light, baby pink and is exactly as pictured.  The pom pom ball pulls on the hoodie add a super cute effect.  They are also functional in pulling the hood tight.  The shorts are pulled with a pink ribbon.  If there was one improvement to suggest, I would prefer a elastic waist with a cute pink bow added in the front.  The bottom sometimes become more loose with movement. I absolutely love these pajamas. They are the most comfortable and stylish I have owned. If you watch closely, you may see me sneak out to the store wearing them as they appear to be a overall short/hoodie set and not just pajamas.

5,"I love the shape and size of these earrings.  They are smaller hoops - about the size of a nickle, but they are wider and thicker than most so they deliver an effect that is both modest and beautiful.  They are perfect for work.  I was very happy to hear a solid click when I secured each one to my ears.  The locking clasps are not too loose and are very secure.

They are rhodium-plated silver, which many may not know is a beneficial feature for sterling silver pieces of jewelry.  Rhodium is far more valuable than silver and it imparts a brighter, whiter effect to it than silver has on its own.  It also serves to help keep the piece from tarnishing.

They are very well made, just like every other piece of Amazon Curated jewelry I own.",Nice thick hoops that are smaller in size but still deliver a lot of sparkle and shine.

5,"Agree With other reviews
I will wear this watch occasionally and when travelling and like having hand winding and hacking for the convenience of setting the watch accurately
The outside edge of the bezel is higher than the inside and so protects the crystal. The markings on the bezel are engraved and filled and will not scratch off. The bezel is firm but smooth to rotate so will not accidently move. There are 2 clicks per minute rotation  of the bezel.
The hour lumes are elevated about half a mm above the dial face and give a nice depth or 3D effect. The lumes are also surrounded by a mm of brushed white metal which enhances daylight legibility and looks nice too.
The crown positions are easily felt when pulling out the crown but again the feel is snug and I feel confident it will not come out accidently when in water.
All in all this is a high quality watch case. It doesn't have a Seiko Divers logo because it's missing a lume pip at 0 min on the bezel(which is a diving ISO requirement) and doesn't have a screw down crown. But given the snugness of the crown I feel confident to swim with it.

I agree  with other reviewers that the band isn't as robust as the case but is still good quality Seiko solid links. I would have preferred a chunkier band, but at a $120.00 price point this is a good value to me. The clasp is very good Seiko branded push button with safety clasp. There is no divers extension.

If you want a chunkier band with solid end links and a screw down crown consider the Seiko SRP309 or SRP307 which also has hand winding and is hacking (you can stop the second hand for accurate setting of time). However these have the sharks teeth hour markers and cost $75.00 more than I paid.

I ordered this watch Amazon 3rd party through Mini Watches out of Singapore and delivery took a week longer than estimated. When I contacted them they replied promptly in 4 hours, and advised to wait another week and the watch arrived as suggested.
They also had a good customs declaration which was very helpful with taxes and duties compared to other watch dealers I've dealt with.

I would buy this watch again and would order through Mini Watches again.",... will wear this watch occasionally and when travelling and like having hand winding and hacking for the convenience of ...

The material is a luxurious stretchy silk. I love the back design and the little ribbons extending from the zipper, a hallmark of this brand. It fits smaller than most Tracy Reese, with the size 0 fitting nice and fitted (this brand's 0s are often large, I find) without being uncomfortable. This is great for an event and fine for business and still works a bit more casually for a nice dinner out. It hits me at 5'4"" at the same place shown in the photo. Note that it's not see-through; it's got a light lining. (Note: it says size 10 on this review for some reason but my purchase was size 0.)",Sexy and Proper at the Same Time

I thought that was a reasonable reply so I waited, and waited and waited for my refund. No refund was made, I contacted them again to no avail.

5,"Yes! This is a very sexy shoe, it's undeniable. The arch is great, the styling is great. I think Pleaser has stepped their game up. I generally wear a 6 in most brands but order up with Pleaser. This one I found true to size. I kept with a 6 and it's perfect. It's not too wide or too narrow either. I generally find pleaser narrow as well (at least in a 6 or 7) but not this style. I wore these for 2 hours without an issue. I could wear them much longer. It's a GREAT sling back, definitely a head turner and it looks like a pricier pair of heels. I love it- I'd buy it in black leather and patent red in an instant- even nude what be amazing. If you are on the fence just do it. You won't be disappointed.",A winner all around!
5,Love love LOVE these pajamas. I immediately bought another pair and then got a pair for my niece as a gift. They are my favorite and I love all the different styles.

5,"Was worried about the fit. I ordered an XXL. I am about 5'9"" and 210 lbs with broad shoulders. It fit perfectly, was not too snug and not too loose. It really does not breath and at times in Hawaii was a little warm. It is light and stylish and can be worn as a shirt. I wore this for 8 days as almost my main shirt. Did not get burnt at all and we were out in the sun non-stop. Only complaint is that is seemed to pick up any dirt or sand if it touched the ground. This is going to be my go-to shirt for any type of water and beach activities.",Great Fit For Big Guys and SPF Protections Works Well

5,"Bought this in women's size S direct from their website (no special measurements since size small almost always fits me.) Arrived in 2 weeks, fit is excellent.

Very nice material quality and craftsmanship, definitely above what I expected for the price. Coat material appears to be wool and has a nice weight and thickness, lining is bright red satin. Stitching on the interior isn't %100 perfect but certainly not bad, exterior seams are smooth with no visible flaws. It's definitely what I'd consider daily wearable quality, a step above some things I've seen at the mall with a similar or higher price tag.

Mine came in black rather than dark blue (or at least that's how it looks under my indoor lighting) has two outer pockets and one inner pocket, and three black buttons at each cuff (these are decorative but do look nice, the cuff doesn't open but the material has a deep fold to look as if it does.)",fit is excellent.

5,"I bought this dress in XS-- I am 5'4"", 115 pounds. It fits really well - fitted on the bottom and slightly loose up top. The peplum hits at the tiniest portion of the waist, and because the top it loose, can be adjusted up or down to fit your specific body type. The fabric of the top portion is thin, feels slightly flimsy and is not stretchy, but the colors are beautiful and bright. The bottom is very stretchy and will accommodate various body shapes. Because I can adjust the position of the skirt portion, It can either be shorter or longer, but it really doesn't go much past mid-thigh for me, so definitely a short dress. Overall, I think it looks very cute, perfect for summer parties.",Very cute

I was a little worried as far as what size to order because he is very tall and skinny. Plus with being a mechanic, shirts that are too big can be frustrating when bent over working on a car. He wears a lot of larger sizes to make up for the shirts length. I took a chance and got a medium instead of a large and when he tried them on they fit perfect! He even wears a clean one on days when he's not working. He says they are very comfortable and breathable and even had me order four more.",Husband LOVES these!

5,"4.5 stars because I am ecstatically happy and I do love it, but there is just one teeny-weeny thing I can think of that would be just a liiiiittle bit more awesome.
First, let me say that I had a key chain with a similar type grab-loop with bling-bling stuff on it. All the bling eventually fell off and the whole thing finally broke. It never occurred to me that the thing I loved the most about it was the loop being so VISIBLE, and so grab-able and so easily FOUND in your purse. It also never occurred to me that sometimes, I was able to slip it over my wrist. That never really hit home (duh..) until I was without it.
Then I noticed a co-worker with a key chain similar to this one. I practically scared her asking her WHERE did she get that key chain?! I had to have it! Unfortunately, that place no longer had them, so I went on Amazon and didn't know how to 'search' until I remembered my coworker referring to it as a 'wristlet', so that's what I typed in the search!
OMG - THERE was my keychain of my dreams! Yay! I love, love, love it. Again - you find your keys right away; you can easily grab them; they can go on your wrist, they don't fall in the black hole.

So, what was the teeny-weeny little bit of improvement, you ask? Well, if the fabric was just a little less 'stiff'. And perhaps over time, it will be, I don't know. But right now, it's so stiff, that it's not quite as 'flexible' as I would like. But you know what, if it NEVER is, I'm okay with that, too.
I'm delighted - seriously. And thank you.",4.5 stars because I am ecstatically happy and I do love it

5,"Bought this For my fiance, I find this brand has very nice comfortable waist bands and fit him very well. I was pleasantly surprised to find them almost too long in the leg as we both are pretty tall. He is a true medium, with slim legs and a bit of a booty so these are very appealing to say the least and are not stressed at any seam with plenty of space for all bits and berries sizes. They ride low on the hips, which is the style. He has worn them around the house, and to bed with no problems with them.

My usual tip with this brand is to hand wash and line dry for lasting quality. You can wash them in the machine just fine, but I always recommend a mesh bag for your thinner materials, or to hand wash.",Get them!

5,"It's an absolute beauty. They are very comfortable, stylish, durable and warm (Montral weather warm). I use them on a regular basis and I walk occasionally for about 2 miles (3km) with them. Very comfortable.
I have had them for about 3 months and by using a shoetree I haven't seen any decline in it's shape so far. Very well done Timberland.
I wear them in Montreal, where it gets cold. Wearing a pair of thicker socks is all it takes to keep my feet warm. I have tried them in -25 C (-13F) and can't complain. Of course I won't wear them in a snowstorm, or on an extremely slushy day.

The only concern that I have is that they run a bit big. I wear 9M on other Timberlands, and also Clarks DB. These feel like they're half a size bigger, as if they're 9.5. It didn't need to break-in, it was never tight for my feet. Unlike CDBs which I have to wear them a few time to break in.
I didn't have a chance to return them and try 8.5M, as I was traveling to US for a few days and had these delivered to me.
Although with thick / wool socks they fit perfectly. They're just a bit loose with thin / dress socks.

I would suggest trying your size and also half a size smaller.","Great, comfortable, stylish boots - might run half a size big"

5,"I am a big guy who has had a hard time finding a quality outdoor coat that fit...until now. The fit was great, the coat is attractive, and function. Nice liner, warm, but not heavy. Repels water well. Well made, good stitching, quality zippers and seams. This is a multipurpose jacket that is perfect for cold weather, rain, wind, and hiking/trekking.
If I was going to make this jacket a little better I'd add two sealed zipper pockets, and perhaps add reinforced tape loops over each breast pocket that are stylish, but can allow a slide lock or carabiner style clip to be attached. You might find a similar jacket at a large wholesale/resale store for the same price, but you won't get this quality, style, and durability. Great buy.","Good looking, good quality, good fit, good price"
5,Love Barse and I love this ring! Its a substantial ring but not huge. I receive numerous compliments every time I were this ring. I would suggest this ring to everyone. My one complaint is that the black paint on what is the bottom of the ring is rubbing off but even then it makes my ring uniquely mine. It would definitely make a great gift!,Beautiful Swirls

5,"its a great jacket. not too thick but thicker than I thought it was going to be thats for sure.(great for a fall type of jacket on cooler days) My daughter is 9. usually 7/8 fits her JUST right. well I didn't want to get 7/8 because I didn't want it to be too small or she grows out of it too fast. so I bought a 10/12. it looked really big on the hanger it came on but once she tried it on, it looked great. the sleeves do go a bit past her wrists but thats expected because I knew it was going to be a tad big on her. I wanted to give her room to grow to get more use of it. My daughter is a bit tall for her age and slender. I hope my description helps with sizing. all in all for the price, its a great purchase in my opinion. and my daughter loves it.",great jacket.
5,"I bought this bag in turquoise and it is absolutely beautiful. You'd think such a bold color would have limited use, but I'm finding it coordinates with many of the clothes I wear. The bag itself is large--large enough to carry my life around, which is pretty much what I throw into a purse: wallet, makeup bag, small umbrella, checkbook, notepad & pens, etc--without being heavy, which is really a plus. I did end up buying a handbag organizer to corral everything and have found the organizer gives the Hobo bag much more structure. Highly recommended.",Beautiful!
5,Great!,Five Stars
5,"The sweater although very nice and packaging was exceptional, the only problem was that the size was very misleading. It stated that the U.S. size for me was lg. When in reality,  being the clothing, which I am assuming comes from China or Korea, the size actually differs tremendously.  I will in the future order either a x-large or xx-large in size. This comment is in no way meant to hender anyone from buying but to hopefully help you in your choosing the right size.","Product size, misleading"

5,"I usually take a size M and oredered a M for the Cartel.  My measurements are 5'9"", 172 lbs, and athletic build with 41"" chest and 32"" waist.  I have a Nobis Stanford and the M fits perfectly in sleeve length and back length.  The Cartel in comparison is a bit puffier and has a bit more room than the Stanford, but the S in the Cartel would have been too tight.  Definitely a warm coat and not too many people wearing Nobis jackets.  Love the magnetic wind flap and removable hood with a shapeable wire in the coyote fur.  Will definitely keep warm in sub-freezing temps and the pit zips for venting is a must for indoors to keep from sweating.  The Cartel is heavier than my Canada Goose Chilliwack bomber but lighter than my Moose Knuckles Ballistic bomber.  Speakers ng of the Chilliwack bomber, the M Cartel fits the same as a Chilliwack bomber and the MK ballistic bomber is way more fitted for a M on me.  Can't go wrong with Nobis products and highly recommended bomber.",Stylish and warm
5,"I purchased this bag a a gift for my sister who was pregnant at the time. I filled it with organic and natural baby supplies and sent it to her as a surprise. I did have concerns about whether she would like the pattern, but I myself thought it was super cute. The colors and hues are the perfect, and it has an eclectic/bohemian look. Well, I sent this bag during the summer and she has had it with her every time we've visited. It's her go-to diaper bag! That really pleased me as a gift giver. I've thought about getting one for myself because it is such a good looking bag that is a great size- it's not too huge but is big enough to carry essentials.",I did have concerns about whether she would like the pattern

HOWEVER, they fit great (I'm 5'5), the slid right on with no major struggle. They are SO beautiful, stunning, & just as comfortable as soft small diamond weave fishnets! (like a lovely full leg hug). I can tell right away that they will not be hot to wear, the pattern allows for ventilation to my legs. This is exactly what I needed to finish off an outfit I've been putting together for an event. The cherry on the sundae, if you will.
I ordered the design in T1. & plan to order many others from this seller. They answered my emails promptly, wonderful customs service. I ordered them on a Friday w/free standard shipping & somehow they got to me from NY to CA by Monday! So quick!

5,"Fits as expected -- I usually wear size XL, and this XL fits well, slightly large for layering underneath.  Plus the sleeves are nice and long.  Very well made.  Looks great.  It's got a 1"" x 5.5"" velcro strip on the left chest and a 3"" x 3"" velcro square on the right shoulder for attaching removable patches.  The lining is just cloth, no insulation, and the outer material is 5.11's thin TacLite PoCo (polyester and cotton) ripstop -- good material but very thin and light.  There are some nice modifications for CC like side-entry lower front pockets with zipped access to your belt, and two velcro-secured hidden chest pockets.  But don't expect a facsimile of a traditional M-65 jacket.  There's no hood.  You can't extend the sleeves.  No drawstrings.  No removable insulated liner.  It has a full-length two-way zipper, not a half-length one-way zipper.  The front lower pockets are side-entry only -- no top entry or flap.  Recommended if you like the design and the TacLite material.",Light jacket looks great

My only complaint is that the back is much longer than I expected- it looks like a high-low/mullet dress. I wasn't expecting such a big difference in the back vs. front. I'm 5'8"" and wear a size 20- the back hits the back of my knees, the front covers my crotch and nearby upper thigh modestly. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase but I think another picture should be added to show how the skirt might wear on a larger dancer.",My only complaint is that the back is much longer than I expected- it looks like a high-low/mullet dress

The waist goes a little bit too high, but sometimes I fold the top over once and it works fine to wear it either way--I actually prefer it folded down. Maybe if I had the small the waist would be just right? Besides the size, I love the pants. Great quality, great color, and I like the mesh on the back of the ankle.

5,"I was apprehensive about buying this for my wife because she's very picky about her jewelry. Part of the reason is I wasn't sure about this is because fake diamonds sometimes just look like plastic. When I opened this box, I knew she'd love it, and she did. It looks like I paid ten times the price for it. The color is super cool and it keeps time perfectly. She wears it to work around her wealthy friends and none of them know I didn't pay $600 or more for this watch. I scored big time with it. She know's it's not expensive, but nobody else does. It shines and looks terrific.
The only drawback was the wristband was too big for her and I couldn't figure out how to take the links out. It will have to go to a jeweler for that,",Looks like it costs way more than it does

5,"This is an excellent everyday watch. It looks better in person than online, and is suitable for anything from T-shirt and jeans to a three piece suit. The movement is almost silent, though you can hear the charging weight whirring quietly when you move your arms. Most other people won't hear it. It is a bit bulky so if you work with your hands it might get in the way, but I only have to remove it when working on my car and usually do when washing dishes. I've submerged it many times without problem, though the band is leather, so I probably wouldn't keep it submerged for hours. I have bumped it against doors, poles and other hard objects and the glass has held up wonderfully. the steel case has a few scuffs because I'm clumsy, but it is well hardened and does not scratch easily. The leather band is of high quality, but I don't really understand the choice of faux alligator grain -I guess it's in fashion. It is consistently 2 or 3 seconds fast per month. And the only improvement I'd really like to see is to not have to adjust the date every other month or so because it is not perpetually datekeeping. That would, of course increase the price of the watch noticably, though.",This is an excellent everyday watch

These did not disappoint though, the fit is so much better for me than their bikini cut.  Their briefs are always way too high for me so these were the perfect in between.  I've been slowly replacing all my bikini cut ExOfficio panties with the hipkini and couldn't be happier!
If you're new to ExOfficio, their sizing is a bit off, you want to size down.  These are great for an active lifestyle.  They let you move freely and are quick drying.  These are my go-to fishing, hiking and camping panties.  When we camp I often wash them in the sink and hang out to dry and it helps to keep the amount of undies I have to pack to a minimum.",Worth the money

5,"When I was reading other reviews prior to receiving this necklace, I found that many said the pendant was ""big,"" and while most said it was about an inch, I kept visualizing this big, honkin' infinity symbol and I wasn't sure how I'd like it. However, when I opened the box with the necklace, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't see it as ""big"" at all- I thought it was a good size; delicate, yet beautiful-looking; and it was nice and lightweight. I like how far it hangs down on my neck, too (see picture)- it's not a super long chain, nor is it super short. It sits at a nice place when I wear it. You can also see in the picture its relative size when it is being worn. Love it!","Simple, pretty necklace"

The fit is slightly small - I ordered a size up since I have a larger bust, and it just fit - so be sure to order up a size, or even two if you want some extra room.

Super cute suit though. It hides all the right things and shows off the others.",I probably should have read the description better but I thought this was a two piece

I play a lot of gym sports so my footwear takes a lot of punishment, and I could never seem to find a shoe that was durable enough to last more than a couple seasons. I bought these at the store a few years ago, and they were AWESOME! Light-weight, comfortable, almost tailored fit. They've got a great grip, so I never have to worry about twisting an ankle or incurring an injury. Plus, they are built to last!

I cannot stress enough how large this bag is, it could easily hold enough items for 1-2 weeks possibly more. Initially I wanted the OGIO brand so it would go along with my backpack which has held its value and durability for years also so I am very pleased with this duffel bag so far.

The pants are a ripstop canvas, and slimmer fitting, but don't restrict moment, and the crotch is reinforced with the same matrial as the jacket. The pearl weave feels very light and strong, and it has a stiff collar. I feel like I could go to the club and chicks would roll up on me and start touching this thing. Definitely worth the somewhat steep price.",Stylish and very well made.

5,"Typical Eagle Eyes product.  i.e very good I presently own about 5 pairs of different configurations.  I bought this pair because I was looking for a lighter lens. The pair I used previously was too dark for driving inside a tinted glass vehicle-this new pair is perfect.  I never owned a folding pair of glasses before.  This comes in handle if you carry them around-they fold up fairly small.  They are very light weight, you hardly know that they are around but they appear to be very sturdy.

Good job Eagle Eyes: I also love their low light glasses which I use at night walking the dog.  Being fairly elderly I was being bothered by night glare especially by the new ridiculous headlights on some of the new cars, their low light glasses were the equalizer preventing headlight blindness.  forgive me for digressing on the review of the foldable but this deserves mention.

I am about five feet 10 inches tall, and I weigh about 200 pounds.  I am larger in the chest and shoulders than would be expected for a man of my age and height, and I would have to go to the extra large size if I gained just a few more pounds.",Quality form fitting tank top.

5,We just got back home from 6 weeks in Florida. The jeweler in Florida was out of these....luckily I found this one on Amazon. It is awesome and everyone compliments me on it. It's a little big for me but I think if it was smaller you would not be able to see the letters. It is a great product that I would recommend as a memento to anyone visiting the Florida Keys.,Love It!

5,"I bought a size 3 for my 2 1/2 year old who is average in height and weight.  It fits her perfect and is ridiculously adorable.  The bright pink looks beautiful against her dark skin.  I had reservations about buying a two piece for a toddler.  However,  I love that it is a two piece that looks like it was made for a toddler, not some overly sexualized looking two piece that others are selling for little girls- gross!",Adorable!

5,"Even before you open the box you know that you're in for a treat. If they put this much thought and fashion into the box just wait till you see what's inside.
I wear a men's 10 and bought the regular, Deco, and they fit perfectly. Their form fitting, almost snug, but not too tight. They're also very stretchy so you can pull them up over your calves making them perfect as a boot sock.  Of course that hides how awesome they look, but you'll know. And that'll put an extra pep in your step!","You get what you pay for, and you are worth it!"

5,"Pay attention to what you see. In the text it states this is an all black watch but in the picture it has a blue tint to it. This is an all black watch. There was another watch that looked blacker then this one but they are the same. I planned to buy both but now I don't need to because they are the same. But anyway I haven't found any problems with any of these china waches so far. Yes you do have to wind them but so far I have received 4 so far (3 winner and this) and they work flawless. This watch does not have overwind protection like the other winner watches so when you wind it you have to feel for the stop point in the tension. I added a picture below so you see what it actually looks like. But I do recommend this product, definitely a bang for your buck",Jaragar Watch

5,"Love this sarong!  I got the jungle brown and the jungle green tie dye versions.  Shipping was fast and the products arrived in excellent condition.  The colors were vibrant, fabric was a quality mid-weight rayon with nice drape, and the edges on the sarongs neatly finished.  I was worried that the size might be a little too large or unwieldy even though I am plus sized.  They were very easy to work with though, and while I have smaller sarongs that get the job of a basic swim cover-up done, these are big enough to do literally anything I want to with with ample coverage to be securely street legal if I need to be.  1 World's Plus Size Sarongs are my new favorite.",My new fave sarong!

5,"Hmmm.  I like everything about this sweater except that it is a bit itchy in the arms (when worn with a short sleeve).  I am surprised by this because 1) the reviews said that it was soft; 2) I have another alpaca item by this company that is not itchy, at all.  That being said - Fits like I expected (I'm a 14 and got a large.  I'm 5'7"" and it comes to mid thigh in the back and upper thigh in the front).  Quality seems to be good for the price.  I got the light grey and love the color.  Although it doesn't close in the front (which is what I expected) there is enough fabric to cover my chest and snuggle up.  I imagine this would look great with jeans or in the office.  I was really looking for a ""house sweater"" - something to wear while working in front of the computer or while watching tv or reading in bed.  I found it!  Bonus that it will look great on the street, too.  Deliver was SUPER fast - got it two days earlier than expected.  I would recommend - just be ware that it might be a little bit itchy on the arms at the sleeves. I might even buy in another color, I like it so much!

UPDATE:  I live in this thing.  It seems to have become softer with wear.  I am literally never out of it and now have to buy another to have so that I can wash this one and still have something to snuggle up in.  VERY happy with it - have moved it from 4 to 5 stars.","Great, but a little itchy to me on the arms"

I enjoy wearing bikinis from my youth but am not comfortable doing so in public, but I REFUSE to wear a granny setup at the beach or pool.  This suit is AWESOME for my situation!!  Very sexy, yet hides the tummy and the material is EXTREMELY durable!!  I cannot stress how great the material is!!!  Words of caution:  You need a fairly decent butt to pull this off as the rear is minimal coverage.  Big busted chicks may find themselves spilling out the top, but if you have breast implants it works well since everything stays in place regardless  :)  I am 5'8, 140 lbs/athletic build, short torso/long legs.",GREAT solution for sexy without indecency!!

I ordered a small even though I though I might wear a Medium because I like my swim suits to fit snugly and to be above my knees a bit so they don't look like basketball shorts. The small fit perfectly (I wear a medium everything else). It comes down to just above my knees and the waist fits well.

I marked the fit as ""somewhat large"" because i genuinely expected to need a medium, but the small was the perfect size. Again, Great Product!",Maybe order a size smaller than you normally wear?

Know how you can fix that?  With a hat covered in fuzzyness, and that's bright red and white to be all festive!  The inside top is not fuzzy (which is perfect, because I can put the hat on over my expertly moussed and toussled hair without messing it up), but the ear flaps and all around fuzz cover your head and neck and keeps them toasty warm (and festive!)  No doubt, an excellent purchase!",It's SO FUZZY!
5,Just purchased a men's Tissot solar blue watch. The box that it came with did not provide a user manual which makes the watch completely unusable. In order to successfully set this watch up the user must have a user manual or someone authorized to work on these watches. I suggest going to the Tissot T-Touch web site and searching for a Tissot T-Touch watch manual. Even with the manual there is a steep learning curve.

5,"Bought these through my local bike shop for only a little more than the price here.  I have wide feet and Sidi's Mega range is the difference between pain and pleasure.  Size is true (I am a 10 EE US, and the 44 Mega is just right).  Sturdy, comfortable shoe, easy to put on and get adjusted. The top strap tensioner and and release mechanism is straight forward and intuitive, though it takes a little care to initially mate the tab into the slot. Carbon sole is very stiff, and has a good feel on the bike. Plastic tread allows reasonable walking, though the heal tread is a bit narrow and I am prone to rolling my ankles, so these are not for strolling about.  Fits inside my Perl Izumi booties for cold weather just fine. Using with Shimano M540 SPD pedals and cleats, no issues. Have not yet worn these in hot weather, but they seem to be well ventilated.",One sweet cycling shoe - in WIDE

With hiking socks they'll definitely be tight but I usually go bare foot or in light socks in these. The elastic is loose enough to allow slipping on and tight enough to keep my foot in. Rubber sole instead of the usual felt. None slip and very convenient.","Beautiful, comfortable and true to size"

Perhaps there is a bit of variation on what you get based on what the other reviewer said, but I am 5'7"", 135 pounds with disproportionately long legs and found the length to be good.

5,"It's a great looking watch. I found no visual flaws on the face however it is not glow in the dark for anyone who may be wondering. The backside contains an engraving of the SO&CO logo(It's very smooth and has never caused me any irritation).

The knob has three positions: fully in to lock the adjustments in place, halfway out to set the day, and fully out to set the time. I've never had any issues reaching the position to set the day. It keeps time very well and the only time I need to set it is for daylight savings.

The buckle is discrete and has no micro-adjustments as some watches do. It did come big (I'm 5' 6'' at about 140 lbs. so my wrists are on the smaller side) however removing some links was not a problem. I simply took a plastic-topped thumb tack and a hammer to remove the link pins (Caution must be used to ensure no damage from the hammer or workspace surface).",Still not sure why it's so inexpensive

5,"The absolute first thing you have to know about this brand is that these shirts do run very small. I am definitely very glad I read a few of the reviews beforehand and that some were kind enough to put their height and weight along with what size they ordered to give others an idea on what size to order. I am 6' and 180lbs and normally wear a large, but because of the reviews I read, I decided to order an XXL. The XXL fits great! Super glad I had the opportunity to review and check out these shirts by Emiqude. I just have to always remember to order 2 sizes up when ordering more in the future.","Great looking shirt, but MUST order 2 sizes up!"
5,"I'm wearing this shoe right now!  Totally comfortable, really cute, but I couldn't agree less with the person who said they had to buy a size down.

These look great with jeans, dress ankle pants or dresses (like today!).  The heal is high, so be prepared for that.",Great comfy shoe.

I love the shaping of the stiletto and the classic style of the pointed toe pumps. The black polka dots on a pink background under the patent finish makes these heels go almost everywhere I would want to wear them without having to worry much about their stability and looking fresh. Later, I decided to order a pair of white Define pumps to have more appareling options.",A Good Looking And Comfortable Pair Heels To Wear

5,"So I am not a hiker, or much of a walker even, but I am in good shape.  I recently finished a road trip to Grand Tetons, Yellowstone National Park, and Badlands South Dakota area.  I wanted some comfortable shoes beyond my Nike/Puma gym shoes. As I new I would be walking and hiking around a considerable amount.  As not knowing about what shoes are best for hiking, and not wanting to go into a store to try them on since I had a short time to purchase, and after reading lots of sites and info and going over hundreds of reviews.  I decided on buying a few pairs of shoes.  I bought a pair of Teva sandals, a pair of Teva hiking shoes, and this pair of Solomon shoes.  The first day I wore my teva sandals, which were comfortable and sturdy, good support, more air circulation of course, but for the hiking part, by the end of the day I had a big blister on the outside of my big toe where the strap comes over.  So I realized sandals were done for the rest of my trip if I was out and about.  So I moved to the Teva hiking shoes.  There worked very well. I got them on sale so definitely cannot complain about them for the price.  I did find them a bit less breathable maybe better for colder times and hikes, and not the hot summer months as I was in.  I ended up rolling my ankle with these at the end of my 2nd day.  Not the fault of the shoes, but my own, just rolling over a rock.  So going into the 3rd day my feet and ankle were hurting and I was not sure how much hiking and walking I could do. But I didn't drive all the way out this way to quit and go home. So I know I had to just tough it out. I decided to try out the Salomons my 3rd day.  OMG, these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever tried on.  As another reviewer had posted, they look cool, aggressive, the big treads on the bottom, make it look like you are a professional hiker, which I am totally not.  So the style caught my eye at purchase, but the comfort has now caught me for good. I also love the lacing technology.  With all the advancements in technology over the years, how come we can't design laces that come apart less and don't need to be tied constantly?  So for the Solomons, just basically pull on the laces and tighten them down with the tab, then tuck the leftover hanging string in the cool little pouch on the front of the tongue. Done. No need to re-tie, nothing to trip over.  The previous day I had to re-tie my Tevas maybe 4 or 5 times.  Never have to with the Solomons.

So these shoes were so comfortable that I wore them the rest of my 11 day trip though the national parks.  I think I would have never made it thru my trip and been able to see as much as I did, after my blister and rolling my ankle if I did not have these shoes.  So I'm so excited to return and write this review, and honestly buy another pair of these shoes.  I seriously don't think I will wear any of my Nike or Puma gym shoes anymore.  With the comfort, cool looks, and lacing, these are the best shoes out there.  I do wonder how long it will take for the treads to wear and if the shoes comfort and support will degrade when that happens, but for now I am very happy.  Hope this helps someone that may be on the fence about purchasing them.  They are worth every penny.  Some reviewers said they are too narrow, could be.  For me I am 5-8, 170 lb male, size 9 with average to narrow feet and they fit perfect.",but I am in good shape. I recently finished a road trip to ...

The additional complications were pretty easy to figure out (the top button adjusts the weekday, and the bottom works the month date, while the 24 hour indicator adjusts based on your regular hour hand)

The bezel is strong with decisive handle, further driving home the point that this watch isn't just a decoration, but a functional tool.

Overall, it is an excellent watch that serves its purpose very well. I swapped out the band with a NATO strap to dress it down a bit (which might make your obsessive horologist cringe, but I like it), and it has served me well!",Great value!

What more could my creepy little macabre heart ask for. The sweater is alot thicker then the picture leads you to believe. Meaning that its a really good quality sweater. My advice is to order atleast one size up though. It's not all that stretchy and runs small. I am a 38 C chest wise and normally wear a 12/14 and got an XL. Its snug. I will air drying it for sure to avoid shrinkage. One size smaller and I am not sure it would have fit very well.,Batty about this sweater!

Stars are embroidered, stripes are not embroidered.  It is made in India, 100% cotton and does specifically say to DRY CLEAN ONLY.  So no sure why folks are washing it.  Mine's going to the dry cleaners.  Size chart Amazon shows is not only incorrect for US sizing, it also does not match what the manufacturer lists as it's size chart.  Shirt does run small.  Manufacturer lists an XL as being 42"" bust, L is 40"".  I would normally order a large, but because all the reviews said it ran small I ordered the XL.  I am glad I did.  No way would a Large fit me.  I might could have gone up to an XXL (44"" bust) but I felt it would be too big.

It is a beautiful red leather, appears to be very well made, has an interior pocket that holds my iphone5 and a zippered pocket for the little stuff that always gets lost in the bottom of a purse.

In my opinion, the price is very reasonable. It was very well packaged, in its own cloth bag, also closed up in a sealed plastic bag and put in a firm FedEx box. Be aware though that you have to be home to sign for this package as it is an international purchase. It cannot be left on the doorstep.

I had tried on a similar suit by Mara Hoffman in a size Small at a department store, and it felt short in the length and I was spilling out of it on top. I have a long torso so I tend to go a size up in bathing suits, especially in designer. Hope this helps!",Flattering Suit!

5,"A beautiful statement piece.  This bracelet comes in a beautiful black box, that slides open to reveal another box which you open.  It measures 7.25 inches around your wrist so should even fit large wrists.  My wrists are small but it also worked fine.  There are tiny diamonds in between the circles but it looks like more as the silver is hammered for that effect.  The stones are a light blue Topaz which is perfect for a December birthday.  For the price it is an excellent value.  This would make a lovely gift for anyone.  I have not taken mine off since I received it.",High quality piece for the price

One thing I really like about these shoes is that they are very lightweight, however the upper is very well structured.  The material is quality as well, it is soft suede-esque in a slightly mottled medium tone grey.  They are a bit narrow, for me that is a good thing.

5,"I got this pajama set for my almost 5-year-old son, who loves Ninjago.  Okay, I'll admit ... I love Ninjago, too.  :-)

The pajamas are incredibly soft yet durable.  The buttons and stitching are excellent and leave no doubt that this set is going to be in use for a long time.  I ordered big on purpose, so he'd have them for a while, and I do believe he will.  The colors are bright, bold, and vivid and the pajamas leave no ""shed"" even on his damp skin after the bath.

I was hesitant to spend so much on a pair of pajamas, but I ordered a little big hoping the quality would last, and I do believe it will.  The tag shows the Ninjago name and trademark - these are definitely legitimately licensed pajamas.  They're cute, comfortable, and of a good breathable material.  Thanks for a wonderful product - I would recommend these pajamas to any fan of Ninjago.  Because they're of the button-up style, they're not going to shrink like the really fitted pajamas.  Excellent purchase.","Initially hesitant because of price, but worth every penny in real life."

5,"Purchased this for my 6 year old. We live in Texas where the weather is hot one day and freezing the next. When it's cold, his hoody wouldn't cover his ears when he went outside to play. I got this for him because he loves minions, especially the ""evil"" minions. The hat fits him perfectly, covers his ears but not his eyes, and stays on. The inside is very soft and not itchy at all, the outside is more of a knit fabric. He loves the hat, and once he's inside and takes it off, he likes to play with it. The eyes puff out a bit which makes the hat more life-like and cute. The stitching seems to be of very high quality, even the hairs sticking out of the top of the hat don't seem to shed at all which I expected it to. Very nice quality for the price, highly recommend.",My 6 year old son loves it

5,I love the fit of this top. It is perfect for a little more support for larger boobs but looks like it could give smaller boobs some lift for cleavage. It's very comfortable. Best of all you can't see nipple outline through the fabric - probably due to the thick quality material and the colours on the design. I bought the matching string bottom with gold on the ties as well as the matching rash guard to go over top. I love this set and can't recommend it highly enough!,I love the fit of this top

5,I don't have foot problems so didn't need arch support. But they are comfortable for quite a long time.  I have a normal width foot and wear a 9.  But based on another review I ordered a 91/2 because my foot does slide down just a little.  I think it's because of the heel.  The little bit of extra length kept my toes from being right on the front edge.  They can be worn casual and are modern-looking.,Good purchase

There would be room for a couple of keys, some cash, credit cards in addition to the phone.  I will use for traveling, but can see it would be good for dog walking or quick shopping trips. A VERY small point and shoot camera could fit, but it would not allow much else.  The top zipper is closest to the body. Pack is thin, sits very close to the body and with an un-tucked shirt could be worn without being noticed.  By my measurements, the waist strap accommodates waists up to 45 inches, but that is fully expanded. Product is just as described.  Got the gray.  Good neutral color.  Nylon material.  Would not expect it to be water proof.","Great low profile ""fanny pack"

There are 7 pockets in all big and small and thes I think it's more than enough to keep my things organize. The price is good for the quality of this bag and I think this is strong enough to carry the things I need on my daily activities. The leather material is a little shinier than I wanted.

5,"This item is really well made and works wonderfully. I love that somebody finally came up with mittened onesies  that can be folded back so little ones can still explore with their hands. Our baby has eczema and he will tear his skin up if given the chance. I'm so happy I finally found something that works. They are a little pricey and my baby has required a whole wardrobe of these and at $35 a piece it's been expensive. I will mention that the scratch sleeves made by this company also work wonderfully (unlike the other brand) and are a bit thinner than the bodysuits so they are great for the summer. At night, my baby was able to get the sleeves off once so I only use the bodysuits for night when he's not being watched in his crib. Also, I wish they came in more colors.  They come in pink, blue and very recently they came out with gray. I would love to see these in greens, orange, light blues etc.  They are beautifully made though and I dropped some extra $ to buy cute animal patches which I sewed onto the chest of each onesie to add some color. It's worth seeing him smile at himself delightfully in the mirror when he sees the colorful creature he gets to wear for that day. As a sidenote, I've become a regular consumer of this product and have corresponded with the owner of the company on a few occasions and she has always been very accomodating and has always provided excellent customer service. I'm so grateful for these onesies and scratch sleeves. They've made life so much easier for our whole family.",pricey but does exactly what is promised

I'm a size 10 and they meet level with the top of my running shoes. Not low enough to slide under my foot, and not high enough that I feel like I've got old man socks on.

5,"This is a *compression* shirt; it's designed to be very snug fitting (I think the reviewer who said it was too small failed to realize this). I'm 5'4"", 125lbs, 37/38S suit jacket and the size small fit *perfectly*.  Check the sizing chart and order what it suggests. The first couple of times you put it on, it'll take a little work, but it'll loosen up a little bit after awhile.

Did exactly what I needed while doing some surfing and taking some falls. The material has held up to abuse. The only thing I'm disappointed in is the white stains a bit quicker than I'd hoped, but it's white, so I can't expect it to stay white for long. I just need to fall less often.","Prefect fit, excellent construction"

5,"My foot is a little on the wide side and I wear a size 7 if it runs true to (US) sizing or a 7.5 (US) if it runs a little small! Normally to play it safe anytime I see a half size offered I will choose the size 7.5, but If your like me in the feet (and weight around 118 lbs.) then you can choose a size (7) in this Bumper Tory02 black cutout with the strap wedge sandal! My middle toe is just slightly longer than my big toe and I still had a perfect amount of room in the length, like it was made for my feet. . . .Now, about the strap that runs across the top of the foot that has no buckle. It is a ""too loose"" across the top of the foot, so what I did is on the inside of the shoe on that strap I easily cut out with a pair of scissors a small half inch section  and was able the easily sew (using embroidery black thread which is at a craft store and is a slightly thicker thread for hefty sewing) the strap together with my fingers and a hand sewing needle. Sometimes you need a pair of jewelry pliers to grip the needle so you can push it through what your sewing as an option to get the job done. When I did that it fit the top of my foot perfectly, like a glove! Now the sandals feel like it was made just for me! :) It was fun and didn't take long to sew! Feels just right when I walk now and I am able to wear these shoes all day! . . .A LITTLE SECRET to let you know, I ordered a second pair (now I have TWO different versions of this sandal) since I discovered that you can also cut the back strap off that goes around your heal and that turns it into a slip-on sandal that looks good with shorts, capri pants or a skirt!  NO, don't worry the sandal will stay ""on"" while your walking just fine and now I can use these sandals around the house too. For example, works great for when your done in the kitchen making yourself something to eat and want to sit in front of the TV with your feet up, just slip these sandal off!  :)","VERY UNIQUE AND COMFY, BUT LET ME SHARE A SECRET!!! :)"
5,"Love these boots. Look amazing, super comfortable and walkable. Not clunky or heavy. Easy to put on. The leather looks beautiful. I ordered a 9 which I thought would be a little small because according to Hudson's size chart my foot is 1mm bigger than a 9. But they fit great, with room to where thicker socks as well.",Love these boots
5,Great looking and very stylish,Five Stars
5,"I love these K. Bell socks.  They are so soft, the colors are good and the fit is exactly right.  Also important is, they are not to tight but stay in place.  They are a perfect winter sock.",These socks do not slide down as I walk.
5,"The instructions for the shoes are to order a half size down from a regular pair of shoes, which is probably what you should do. At first, it really hurt the sides of my toes because I have very high arches and am very wide at the balls of the feet. I still leave the laces loose at the bottom of the shoe but my toes don't go numb unless I really strap the shoes down any more (which is normal).
Being my first pair of lifting shoes, I wasn't entirely sure how this would go. They're not the secret to better squats, but the support in comparison to what I was lifting in is absurd. It feels great to be so solid. The height of the heel is just enough for me to ATG low bar without compromizing my back. I've only had these for a little more than a month but I have squatted and deadlifted every day without seeing any signs of damage.
My only complaint is that there were small flaps of material where my pinky toes are that digs into them and caused a lot of pain. I super glued them down but they still cause problems so I have to be careful to angle my foot just right into the shoes when putting them on. Otherwise, they're everything I hoped for! That's why I give them a five. Highly recommended.",Shoes of Dreams

Other shoes in this style didn't have nearly the support and cushioning of the Earth Origins.  The sales woman at DSW even came up and asked how they were fitting because she bought a pair for her mother and her mother loves them.

My guy's a 49 inch chest, and we took a chance because the size chart said the largest size available is for 46 inch chest.  We really liked the style so thought lets give it a try.  Turned out the XXL has plenty of room with even more to spare (size chart be damned).  The adjustable laces to shorten the sleeves worked out great too.  The material is soft and much better quality (thicker) then Viscose Rayon usually is.

The only thing is that there are two pieces that come apart.  If you have a problem figuring out how to do an infinity knot, this is not the bracelet for you.  The clasp is also hard to open.

The good thing is that it is not flimsy; the weight and strength seem very durable.  With moderate use, I expect to get several years out of this set.",Beautiful Piece

Also the fact that the hood is lined and half of the lower sleeve is padded are nice touches. But Im completely sold on this brand for quality and style. It is tempting to get the striped one as well. While its not close fitting it isn't your loose hip-disguising sweat either- it will show your bulges. The upside of that is that its dressy and looks great with a short swing skirt. Ive worn it continually since I got it as it feels and looks classy.",Classy sweat

Only compliant is there are no eyeholes, but when wore, the fabric over the face stretches so you can sort of see in well lit room.  But I would not recommend walking around on your own at night in the suit, you won't see a thing!  The fabric also pulls tight over your face, so It can press up against your face. I put a pair of non-prescription glasses on under to give some space for my eyes.

The zipper is a 2-way zipper, so you can zip it open anywhere along the zipper.  You can wear it with the head off and use a mask, but thats the best part of the suit.

5,These shoes only came in medium so I had to get a half size larger.  They run a little narrow.  Plus there is a support thing to keep the shape of the toe of the shoe in tact.  It can sometimes rub against the large or pinkie toe of your foot on a shoe that is your correct shoe size.  So once again get a half size larger.  Once u find the right size they are comfy and stylish.  They feel like I am wearing sneakers.,Comfy general Purpose  casual/business casual shoes that you can wear with anything

The stainless steel shines and the watch definitely has a nice clean look.  The glass meets the face smoothly and edges all transition very well.  The watch itself is very thin, which works well for people like me with small wrists.  The band is also attractive with some good texture and quality stitching, reading 'genuine leather' on the back.  As the watch wears over the next several months/years I'll update my review.

5,"I bought this luggage from another retailer. But as i relied on amazon reviews to inform my purchase decision, i felt a need to jot down my experience.

Pros: i loved this spinner. I was sold by its ""tech"" look. It is sleek and matches well with my electronics such as my Ipad. Its design makes me feel like it is a product by Apple, especially when you look at it from the side. The lock/latch is genius. It is so easy to open/close with just one click. Wheelers are great. Travel pouches help and the buil-in plastic bag obviates the need to buy a toiletry kit. The lining is of high quality and the frame feels durable. I do not check in this bag because this is a carry-on. I think it meets the requirement of many domestic carriers. Otherwise, there is a cover bag to protect it against possible scratches or scuffs.

Cons: as with other hardcase luggage, you should not and can not overstuff it. But as I always manage to travel light, it does not really count as cons for me.

For its look alone, it is worth the money, especially when you buy it at a discount. Let alone its quality and the unique identification system. I highly recommend this luggage as a carry-on.",Great value for money

That said, the style is good, the bag is very firm and upright, and the gold is quite striking.

3,"Three of these pairs fit great.  The socks with words on them are extremely tight at the top.  The thread they used to stitch the words hasn't a bit of stretch to it so unless your leg is roughly as wide as the sock un-stretched you're likely not getting that pair on.  The other three socks stretched beautifully.  They're medium weight, stay put without squishing your leg, and have held up fine with no threads coming loose through several wears and washes.",The socks without words stitched on them are fantastic.
3,Another good looking shoe.  Runs VERY large!,And he ran right out of his shoes...

We needed to have the wrist band adjusted so after purchasing the tools, tried at home and failed to pull the pins so we took to the watch repair shop and even she was amazed that how a authentic Bulova watch (?) can give such a trouble in pulling out pin. Even for her, it was quite an effort.

3,"This knockoff isn't the best I've seen, and isn't the worst. I bought a few different kinds on Amazon to see which one is best, and this one falls in the middle. Structurally the piece is solid and remains shut when you put it on, which is more than I can say for some of the others.

I am a guy and it is big enough to fit my wrist (two other kinds I purchased through amazon were a bit tight on my wrist - this is the largest). I ordered this one in rose gold, and it is not very shiny. Looks a bit brassy.","Good structure, color and shine are a bit off."
3,"It's a comfortable dress with a high enough neckline that you're not flashing cleavage or bra straps, but for me, it's impossible to wear as a dress without leggings or skinny jeans. It's pretty short in the back and I couldn't sit or bend over without showing my underwear. So, as a tunic, it's nice. As a dress, not so much.

3,"Beautiful coat, but be prepared to reinforce the buttons. I've had this coat for about two days now. I've only worn it twice, and I've already had to resew one of the buttons back on the coat. The little button flap attached to the left sleeve of my coat was detached when I got it out of the packaging. I had to sew it back on before I even wore it for the first time. The other buttons are hanging on by a thread, literally, so I'll definitely be reinforcing them before they fall off and get lost. Aside from that, it really is a beautiful coat, and the style and loose swing of it gives you a fancy Jackie O feels, especially when you button it up. The lining is also very nice. Not that thin, flimsy, tissue paper type of lining that's no good below freezing. I wore my coat out in 4 degree weather this morning without a sweater underneath, and I felt pretty toasty.

3,"The online ""photos"" have, as with many items that come in a lot of colors, had the colors applied via software, and not an actual product shot. Fine in many cases, but not this one.

When referring to colors in this review, it's specifically the Europa Purple/Flash Light combo

The weave of the fabric allowed one to see the weave of the internal color. When the colors are similar, it'd be no big deal. But in this case we have a purple exterior and a bright chartreuse interior. So two colors that are nearly opposed on the color wheel and a result that looks very odd in person.

The fit was fine, no faults there.

The fabric weight of the womens waffle is lighter than the mens - just an FYI",Inaccurate color online

They were the correct narrowness and good quality too. I wore it first on a weekend trip. Walked on it the whole 2 days in malls and around town. After the 1st day, I felt a little bit of pinching on the left foot- top part, right where the crease is when you make a step. On the 2nd day, the pain intensified. I still continued to use it thinking it is just because it was new. I used it for a week and the pain did not go away. Looks like there is a small bruise to where the boot was pinching my foot. I did not wear these boots for 3 weeks and the pain disappeared. The next time, I wore these boots, the pain came back after about 2 hours of wearing them. Again, I dod not wear these boots for several weeks and then wore it again - same thing. The pain came back.

It does have nice leather...

UPDATE: Well, I feel silly for raving about these shoes. Every pair of Skechers shoes I have ever bought has lasted for at least 1 1/2 years. Kids' as well. Then we give them away with plenty of wear left in them. But not these. Our son says they are very comfortable, and I have noticed the soles are wearing away quickly. He wears them on average 20 days a month, and for about 6 hours at a time. I know Skechers has some great quality shoes, but I don't feel these are their best. We like them, but they will not last as long as any others we've owned. And we each own one pair at a time.",Best pair of shoes our son has ever had... HAD. Lasted almost 7 months
3,"I am a little confused by these boots. At first, I thought there must have been a mistake or that they are Miz Mooz knock-offs. They came in a plain white box; not the usual bright orange that makes my heart race with anticipation when opening for the first time. Inside, the boots say Miz Mooz Inuovo and are made in Turkey.  I own over 30 pairs of Miz Moos shoes and boots, and these are completely different than any of the others. I like them...I think; the Amazon price was exceptional, and those cool little brass studs in the back are really neat. I also like the height of the tall shaft. That's the good. The cons here are that they are sort of stinky, the dye was slopped on in many areas, the soles are rubber with fake stitching and inside, the soles have little or no cushioning. The shaft is quite wide and slouchy, so kinda cute with skinny jeans or leggings if you like that look. If you want a more form fitting boot, or you have skinny calves, I would avoid these. In sizing , I went with a 39; I am usually between an 8 1/2 and 9 in Miz Mooz. These were quite roomy, but I don't think I would have gone down in size.",I like them.

As noted by another reviewer, there is a little baggie attached with the metal clasps for the overall top. No directions are included so I have to try to figure out how to piece it together.

I would have given it a 4 star rating except that the right pocket has a whole in it because it was not sown up! This is poor craftsmanship. For the price charged they should have inspected the item to make sure that it fit properly. Also they should invest in directions or maybe properly assemble the clothing before selling it. It is not  a puzzle that I would have to solve just to wear the item the way it was intended. It is the responsibility of the designer to make their clothing usable out of the bag.",Good overall but could've be outstanding if only!
3,"Ok, lets see how should I start. Overall, these are nice looking straps and they are unique in their design and look. I have been using nylon straps for my watches for a long time, and this the first time Im seeing a design that is a printed patterns rather than strips of different colors. The quality of the stainless still buckles are nice and they are made nicer than the average ones in market. The nylon straps feels softer in touch, but slightly thicker. Their surface feels slightly smoother than most of the nylon straps. The connections are sewn and stitched instead of heat sealed, which I liked them better. Now lets get to the complains. It seems like there is a inconsistency in their production line, to be more precise, their measurements. I purchased a few different patterns in one order, and I am going to compare three of them next to each other. Number one has exact measurements as other brands (Standard dimentions for NATO style G10 20mm straps); however, the other two did not. Number two was one inch longer than number one (Its been shorten 2 inches in the picture) and the placement of the third ring was almost an inch off from where it supposed to. Number twos print looked duller than the third one, looked kind of faded, even though it is exactly the same pattern. Number Three is exactly as number two in the pattern (I purchased two in my order), but it is two inches shorter than #2 and one inch shorter than #1 (One inch shorter than the standard length of NATO style 20mm nylon straps). Overal, I do like their printed pattern design a lot, however, for 17.5$ for each strap, Im not sure if they worth it. I hope they fix the inconsistency and inaccuracy in their production and hopefully reduce their price to a more reasonable range.",these are nice looking straps and they are unique in their design ...

3,"These hats are cute but I'm not certain I would purchase again.  I bought 3 (different colors/sizes) for my 13 mo old, 3 year old and 5 year old.  Here are the pro's and con's

Pro
- I like the chin strap for the older kids (3 & 5 yr old) as they did not bother it and it helped keep it on their little heads
- It has Sun protection

Cons
- Chin strap for the 13 month old seems dangerous.  There is a ""safety release"" latch but I found my son pulling on the hat quite a bit where the strap ended up around his neck and the latch never released.
- The hat is a little warm for the kids due to 2 layers and the material.
- This hat is not made for the water!  If you need to use it in or near water, get a different material!
- The Strap around the top (for sizing purposes) was a nice idea BUT it is ugly (plain white) and would be much better if it had some stretch/elastic in it.
- Price!  At $17.99 each, I was expecting something nicer.  Quality is not bad but definitely not anything special either.  I feel like this should be priced around $9.99 instead for what you get.

I ordered the Large for the 3 and 5 year old.  It is a little big on them but it works for them, especially with the strap around the top.
I ordered the Medium for the 13 month old.  Again, it is a little big on him but works due to the strap around the top.",Ok but a little too expensive for what you get

It reminds me of John Travolta (and maybe The Fonz - ayee!) (A little old school - classy - but not Tokyo drift trendy - if you catch my drift!).

3,"Sizing is off. I'm a pretty solid 32HH, just professionally measured last year. From experience finding bikini tops running small I went up to 32J. Band is a little loose and cup barely fits. Straps are way too narrow for the size. Cups keep shape too low.","Runs small, narrow straps, low set"

The pictures on line make it look more blue, which I didn't really like, so I was happy that it was very dark shade of blue.  The watch face has more chrome finish than I cared for, so I ended up returning the item.  The return process was flawless and free, so basically all it cost me was the gas to get it to the return site.","Nice watch, but not to my liking"

3,"This is a great Sherlock design-very clever-but the shirt was just a tad snug in the hips and chest compared to other Tshirts I've ordered of a similar size.  The material feels synthetic and is thinner than regular cotton, plus it seemed ""shiny"" or slightly coated in something. A few washings should dissipate the shininess, however, it's not my favorite Sherlock shirt for the noted reasons.  Definately is made for male body, so will be snug in hips and chest for ladies.  Plus, the inside of the shirt is a different color-a streaky grey-white.  When I hold the shirt up to the light, you can see through the single layer material.  This is not noticeable when wearing it, but it is a thin material.","Thin, synthetic, slightly shiny/coated fabric, fits snug for ladies."

in the winter as the toe box is big enough with out pinching my toes.
They look like a rubber winter boot and that is what I don't like. It says they are leather but just don't look like it. I wanted a dress
leather navy boot.
I will probably keep them because they have a big restocking fee if I send them back, and were very reasonable in price. We have a long winter here in Va, so can use them in the snow.
I guess I will try for a more dressy navy leather one and make sure I read the return policy first.",Navy but not the look I wanted!

I was so lucky to score a pair of 11s for $32! Ordering 1 size down worked perfect for me.
After trying them on around the house I can tell they're going to rub on my pinky toes a little but I'll make sure to cover them when i wear them out.
Such a great deal

I was so glad to find these in a 12 since not even the Nine West site carried that size.
I normally wear a 12 and these were too big.

They're very loose around the ankle.

The quality seemed sub-par for a normal Nine West shoe too.

I might try an 11 when my order is returned.",Fits a size big.

For reference, I'm a 5' 5"" 125lb woman and I found that it's quite too long! The end dragged on the ground a bit, even after bringing it up way past my hips. Its clear this skirt was made for taller women since the hips fit well, it's just the length.

Another thing probably worth mentioning is it's a tad see-through. Yes, this skirt is very thin! Its great for hot summer days but that's about it.

All in all, it's a great design and I'll still wear it if it's hot enough, but the dragging sort of bothers me.","Pretty, but not ""one size"""

3,"Pros: It looks nice
  It keeps time pretty well for a cheap watch
  Some of the pins are removable in the band to make it sizable
  Can be manually wound at the crown

Cons: The automatic winding does not work properly.

Thoughts: I could have gotten a dud, but I'm not sure. The weight on the back of the watch tends to get stuck, quite often. When it gets tuck, it requires a hard tap to the side several times before it spins again. When it does spin, it barely goes half a revolution before it becomes stuck again. I rated this watch at 3 stars because it still functions when manually wound, and it has nice aesthetics, but the automatic winding feature does not work.

If you are looking for a nice looking watch that holds time fairly well, and don't mind manually winding it a couple times a day, this is a good watch for the price. If you're looking for a cheap automatically winding watch, look elsewhere.",Practically a manually winding watch.

HOWEVER - there is no memory foam in this shoe to speak of. The insole has a 1 1/4"" x 5"" strip of memory foam that's about 1/16"" thick that does no good at all. It goes under the heel but stops under the arch and doesn't extend to the ball of the foot where it would do some good. Compared to the other Skechers I have which have a thick memory foam insole throughout the entire shoe this one has practically nothing! I'm going to buy a full memory foam insole insert and add it - then they'll be a great pair of shoes! And with as little as I paid for these shoes I can afford to add them and still be under $50 total.

Lume is typical at this price point/not good but usable. The good? The watch is good to look at. The open heart design is really an eye catcher and I have had a few compliments on it in only two days of wear. I put a couple of different nato straps and that really makes it pop.

It had flyaway stitches that some were a half an inch long, I had to use a torch to burn them down. I could've (should've) sent it back, but really, if it lasts a couple of years, I'll be fine with that. There's one spot where the bill meets the actual headpiece that is partially missing, and that is where the most threads that needed 'burning' was. If this was a $6.00 cap I wouldn't even mention it, but a $13.00 cap should at least not be made so crappy that it makes you wonder how long it'll make it. Yeah, Propper is a name, I know, but they won't have that name too long if they continue selling junk like this. Maybe mine was a fluke, but just be cautious if you want perfection, I seriously doubt that you will get it with at least this cap.
I will say that I have Propper pants and shirts, they are fine, I was impressed with them, hence my mentioning this.

EDIT: Discovered that holding down the light button on the watch will change the color of the light. Red/Blue/Purple/Green/all colors flashing are the options.

The pictures and videos look so much better than the actual product. I understand this is what marketing is all about, in all honesty I was expecting better. I got the ""Slow Jo 22 - All Black Mesh"". It looks clunky and somewhat cheap, it's simply not as stylish as in the promo pictures. For the relatively low price, I guess it's fine.

3,"I've run several trail marathons in these while training for a much longer ultra i have coming up.  Here's what i found:
-I feel these run just a hair short, which wouldn't be a problem except the upper doesn't hold my foot in place well enough to keep my big toe from repeatedly hitting the front when braking on downhills.
-They don't drain well.  After a small stream crossing i found my feet still squishing a half mile later and that's unacceptable to me.  I've since corrected this by replacing the insole which soaks up water like a sponge and creating a few small drainage holes in the upper.
-The protection underfoot is great!  It is a firm ride but it seems to work for me.
-The traction/grip is adequate but not fantastic on wet rock.
-They transition from trail to road pretty well.  Good for that long trail race that has a few miles on road.  I wouldn't wear these for a 50k or shorter on very muddy terrain; I have other shoes that perform better on that terrain.","It's been a half mile since that last stream crossing, why are my shoes still squishing!?!?"

Unfortunately the center stone rattles and I can see clearly that one prong isn't properly on top of the center stone and the one next to it isn't quite right either, looks a bit twisted.

3,"Pros: Nice material, holds a decent amount of books, and has great pockets. There are four outer pockets, including dual side pockets with cinching straps for tightening. I really like the pockets and feel they are a main feature of this bag. It's nice to be able to carry a water bottle in one side pocket and an umbrella in the other. Never had a backpack with that capability before.
Cons: Cheap zippers, flimsy loop handle, flimsy inner pockets, inadequately padded shoulder straps. The loop handle at the very top of the bag is kind of worthless; it popped a stitch the first time I lifted the bag with it, so now I don't even touch it. The shoulder straps aren't padded well so my shoulders ache a bit if there is any significant weight in the bag. For the record, I typically carry a 3-ring binder, 5 folders, and 3 textbooks inside this bag. That makes it pretty heavy.
So far, I like this bag. I've carried it in the rain and it held up well. I've set it down on classroom floors and it never seems to look dirty. Note, if you order the army green color, it does look darker and greener in person than it does online.","Compact, nice material, nice outer pockets"

3,"This is a high quality suede boot. The inner lining is wool which I love. I would have rated this five stars, but for me the sizing is off. It's almost like this boot design is made as a unisex boot and they change the tag for women's shoes, which I think can throw off the sizing.

Typically I wear a size 8 in shoes, and sometimes I size up a 1/2 size with boots so I can wear thicker socks. When I received these boots in a size 8.5,  it fit closer to a size 9.5 or larger. The exchange for a 7.5 was very easy. The 7.5 is still a bit long, and I probably would have fit better in a size 7, but the 7's were double the price of the 7.5. So I stuck with the 7.5.

I really like these boots, but feel they make my feet look longer than normal, and I am hesitant to wear them often because of this. If I would have tried them on in the store and got a size 7 I would probably be happier. With that said they are extremely well made and comfortable. I would definitely buy Woolrich shoes again, but would start with a size smaller than my normal size.

UPDATED REVIEW: I've only worn those shoes twice because they are so big. I compared them to other shoes in the store and the size 7.5 is close to a size 9.5. It's too bad, because I really like these shoes but can't wear them due to the highly inaccurate sizing, 2 sizes off.","High Quality, Excellent Craftsmanship...but sizing way off (2 sizes larger than size listed)"

Benny Hill comedy sketch entitled "" the loud pants"". And even though its in the dead of winter, as soon as I put these pants on, I felt hot.
So I took my scissors and cut and ripped the lining out at the waistband. It took me less than five minutes to get the lining out. I will be wearing these as pajamas, so I don't care if they are a bit flimsy without the lining, but you might.",Pants for a Benny Hill show

3,"Hmm, I am not quite sure what to make of this little thing. I don't see where it could be worn except at a party, club, rave, costume, cosplay....Maybe could be worn under another skirt or dress to poof it out.
Unfortunately, I'm not sure what size I received, but my hips are 34-35"" and it fit great, even had some extra room, very stretchy what with the elastic hem. I think the reviewers that say it is a kid's size may have just ordered a size too small - and this ""skirt"" IS made to be tiny.
It consists of four layers of tulle, cut jagged at the ends and an elastic waistband. I got the white color which is pretty see-through, not sure about the other colors. I would imagine the black wouldn't show as much. Even though it is ""costume-y,"" it actually is not of horrible quality and doesn't look too cheap, except maybe for the shiny waistband. It is much better than a similar petticoat skirt I purchased from Wal-Mart one Halloween. Does tend to move around a bit, say, if you were dancing.

For the price for 2 lenses, I can't complain too much, but if these break (and they're thin!) I would probably look for a better quality lense rather than buying these again.  My complaint is not so much how thin the lenses are, but how difficult the short clips make putting them on. Even if you aren't trying to put them on while you're driving, it's still annoying to have to fiddle with them several times while you're sitting in the driveway.",Okay clip-on lenses spoiled by short clips that make it hard to put them on your glasses

It fit loosely, but the sleeves were too short and the front did not cover the crotch, though the back came down to the knees.

Quality issues aside, it does look kinda cool if you're into orange-y watch straps, and it does shine up pretty well with a bit of standard-practice shoe-polishing strategy. The leather seems to be decent, and the length is perfect. It's not so long that I have a ton of extra strapping to try and wad up under the hardware.

I live abroad and a return would have been impossible due to the involved costs.",very disappointed. The dress is very nice
3,"I generally consider myself to me a ""medium"" in most things but I'm really glad I got a large in this. The top is wide but not very long at all so when I raise my arms, my belly shows. For sleeping, I prefer longer shirts. The neckline is definitely large though so it slides around.

I was afraid the shorts would be too big but the elastic waist lets them sit comfortably on my hips. They are somewhat loose but not as much as I expected.

Overall, these are very soft and comfortable for sleeping and hanging out around the house. I just prefer my clothes sized a bit differently.",Comfortable for relaxing

3,"I loved the look and style of these shoes.  I actually bought them to wear to my wedding!  I had to return them primarily because the straps were too loose on my feet.

3,"First, I love the shirt. Great style and perfectly cut tailoring but still fits... tight. Not unwearable or embarrassing, but still... a US XL usually fits loose on me.

What bums me out about this is that I still have a Ben Sherman I bought in the early 90's, and I know for sure that it's not the XXL that this one is, but fits about the same. Twenty years later it still looks great, seams are solid, buttons all in place, and although fit has changed since my early 20's, I can still wear it.

Unfortunately, the only thing about my first Ben that shows any wear is the tag inside (no idea what size it claimed to be, quite sure it wasn't XXL), so I made sure to check my measurements since I know my chest is broader than that skinny kid I used to be, and despite my pride, ordered the XXL. The biggest size they make!!! Still (wearably) tight.

Since they are among the best tailored, well made, durable shirts (not to mention stylish) I've ever owned, I guess I'm going to have to focus on more cardio training and mass maintenance if I want to continue supporting them. Or maybe they'll realize American boys are meat and potato fed and adjust their dimensions to fit 6' tall, 200lb, 34"" waist guys. I'm sure I'm not the only one... at this point I'd rather swallow my pride and buy XXXL, well tailored clothes than a sloppy American XL.",Trust the Ben Sherman sizing chart!
3,The quality was very nice but I've returned it to exchange for a 2XL rather than a 2XLT. The tall was VERY long. I'm 6' tall but the T sized vest came down past my butt. I hope the 2XL is better because the material and cut were nice.,"Tall means ""TALL"""

3,"I bought the black, and the gravel. Nice comfortable vest, downside is the pockets are not zippered and fairly shallow. I do not feel comfortable putting my phone in it. Also the gravel color is like a dark olive/gray. Black is not very black, more of a dark dark gray. It is a good value if you don't care about pockets that much. Also I found the length a little short, but I like my vest to fit pretty snug and I bought an extra small. 58 and 125.",Gravel is olive/grey. Black is not that black.  Shallow pockets.
3,"I love my Sabrina 6G so thought the Sabrina Chelsea would fit similarly. However this shoe is very big and bulky feeling. I liked that it was chunkier than a classic Chelsea, but this was bulky and not flattering. My husband thought it looked masculine, and I thought it looked a little bit goth, neither of which styles was I shooting for personally. They also were not comfortable. The tab in the back rubs and the shoe is very big inside. So, bummer. But worth a try.",Better in concept than in real life (for me)

3,"Cute but definitely runs small. I am usually a Medium or a 6 in pants. I bought the large based on the reviews. I kept it but I could probably use an XL. I do have a round butt, but I would still assume a large would have offered the appropriate coverage. This is skimpy in back. The other issue, and reason for just 3 stars is that it uses wire (like underwire in bra) to maintain the shape of the cutout strips (which is cute) but after wearing for a few hours the wire started to jut into my hip. I will try one more wear, but if the issue is still bothersome the bottoms will end up in the trash.",Runs small and wiring at hips is uncomfortable

However, while other Ben Sherman Large shirts fit, this one just barely fits across the shoulders and upper chest. The sleeves are just barely long enough. Also, be aware that the pocket is very small and should just be considered decorative, not really useful. On the plus side, the fabric is attractive and has a good feel to it.

The zipper is always getting caught on the material, and your wallet sinks too deeply in the pocket.  They could improve this.  The pros: it's light & sufficient for short stays outside in cold.  You can pack it or stuff it anywhere.  I haven't used it for activities (like running), as I already have an EMS Gortex shell for outdoor active stuff.

3,"I love(d) this bag!  The bag itself is a high quality thick canvas, had plenty of pockets/ compartments.  However, the little leather tabs used to pull the zipper shut broke almost immediately that is why I'm giving it three stars. I should have used super glue prior to the first use to prevent it from happening! One is now lost forever (kinda like socks in the dryer) since I didn't notice when it first happened. I haven't had this bag a month yet, so it's very disappointing since it hasn't been used in remotely rugged situations (unless packing and carrying to and from my car is ""rugged"").. It clearly is a design flaw!!  I had high hopes for this bag, the bag itself is awesome, the color is nice and neutral, it holds three changes of clothes and other necessities I pack quite easily. The three stars is for the poor quality of the tabs and how quickly they broke. At this price point I expected more.",Love.....and Hate.

I was given a 10% discount for the inconvenience which was nice but I was still pretty bummed that I received the wrong one. The necklace itself wasn't quite what I had expected asside from the colors as it looks extremely cheap and is huge.

I am ordering another pair a different color and a size smaller to see if that helps because I do love the quality of the material.  I am usually a size 6 or 8 in US but I ordered a 31 so the next down is 29 I hope it is somewhat tight because if anyone knows about this material you are to brake them in and they get bigger after so many washes and wear then conforms to your body.

The boots are beautiful and are as the picture depicts. However (cons) the leather is not given thus the boots are less than flexible when you are walking.  The design of these boots pose some challenges as well. The arch inside the boot keeps the owner on the tips of toes. This will cause many issues if you intend to wear them for a great length of time. Secondly, there is not padding for cushion inside the boots. This lends to the arch awareness stated previously.

Other than items listed the boots are beautiful and the sole of the boots keep you stead even I wet weather. This was a pleasant surprise given the height of the heel.  You will feel stable.",The boots come wrapped pretty well to prevent damage to the gold plated chain ...

3,"I never write reviews, but the reviews for this jacket were so helpful that I felt the need to write my own. Let me start by saying that I do love this jacket! It came within the two day prime window as expected. The jacket I received is 100% what is shown online.

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

 it runs small- I like my jackets to be loose, so I usually order a size 10/large. After reading reviews, I sized up and bought a size 16. *USE THE SIZING CHART GIVEN* it is accurate.

the pockets are fake- not a big deal to some, but for someone who constantly loses things, pockets are a must for me so I was upset about that

the grey underplayed is a very thin vest NOT attached in any way to the jacket itself. Its not a huge deal, but once you take the jacket off, you have to worry about keeping both pieces together. Ill probably put a stitch in the jacket to keep them together.

The last thing to keep in mind is that the material is incredibly thin. In my opinion, this is the perfect spring or early fall jacket.

3,"PROS:
This dress is very cute. I've gotten tons of compliments on the colors.
The sheer fabric is lined, which is nice and definitely ups the quality feel.

CONS:
I'm not actually plus-size, but I ordered it because it was a great price and I just wanted something loose and comfortable to wear around the house and on casual days at work. Even so, the dress is a little tight across the bust and the skirt doesn't flare at all like it does in the photo.
After 3 or 4 wearings, I started to notice fabric threads sticking out all over the place; I have to pull the scissors out for another round of minor trimming every time I wear this dress now.

I actually like this dress a lot, despite its shortcomings, and would buy it again as long as the price was right.","Got what I paid for, but I like it"

3,"My husband has two other Dickies coats and loves them for work. Both are waist length, and he's been wanting something longer for colder days and I thought this would be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the sizing is way off compared to his other Dickies coats - he always wears a Medium in this brand but this coat fits like an oversize Large in the hips and waist, and an XL in the shoulder area.

Because the measurements seem so off, I'm including them here:
Shoulders 19"" across
Chest/Waist/Hips 48""
Sleeve 26"" Long
Length at Back 31.5""

My 3-star review isn't based on the sizing though. Most hip-length coats have some sort of cinch system in the waist area so you can draw the coat in close, this keeps warm air inside, and cold air out. This coat has no such option, so unless the fit is near perfect, it's not very warm because of the cold air coming in underneath. The insulation feels like it could work well, and the cordura is relatively wind-proof, if it had some sort of inner belting at the waist it would be a great mid-weight winter coat.","Oversize fit, no way to cinch in at waist or hips"

I don't wear them anymore because I wouldn't want to break my ankle, but I have another pair of Rocket Dog in black and don't have this issue.  Maybe I just got an off pair in the brown...but the black ones are still comfortable and I'm still wearing them.

This dress is really cute and absolutely adorable, but it is very cheaply made. Cheaper than anything I have personally bought from Forever 21. The lace started to tear off the shoulder after a few washes in the washing machine. The top and bottom is shear, so I recommend you wear something under it. The color isn't as pale as the picture is depicted by the seller. Its a little more saturated color. It does come with the belt. I have worn the belt with other outfits. The current price is a bit steep for what you get.

This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because to share my experience with other potential customers. I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.","Adorable, but Very Cheaply Made"

3,"I have ordered several of the Eudora Harmony Bola necklaces and colored bell balls. Overall, I love the look of the necklaces, the colors of the bola balls, and the gentle sound of the chimes. I've received numerous compliments on them. My ONLY complaint is, with a couple of the bola balls, the colors are identical and should not be listed as separate colors, in my opinion. I ordered both the ""blue"" and the ""sky blue"" bolas because the pictures on the website presented them as being close in color but not identical.  There did appear to be some degree of difference in the shades. Same with the ""coral"" and the ""orange red"" bolas. Again, close, but not identical. When I received them I found that, in fact, the blues WERE identical, as well as the reds. This is the only complaint I have with this product, but I felt I needed to express it. Thank you.",I love the look of the necklaces

3,"I've been buying/wearing Newport Polarized sunglasses for many years. My previous pair, Newport Cruisers, are the best I've ever had but are showing their age and the lenses got scratched when I accidentally leaned them up against a brick wall. I loved those so much and have been trying to find another pair for quite a while, even contacting Newport Polarized about it, with no success so I finally bought these Regatta's.

These are just fine sunglasses but I do not like them nearly as much as my old Newport Cruiser. They fit tighter, but not too bad. They're definitely very shinny, which I do not want but should have realized from the listing but was expecting a more matte finish based on my previous pair of black Newports. They also don't seem to be quite as well made/premium as my old Newports. That said, the polarized lenses are great and work exactly as they should.

Giving them 3 stars because they're alright, are of decent but not great quality, and don't look as good in person as in the pictures; although maybe they deserve 4 considering the amazing price. I'm just not nearly as happy with them as I was with my old Newports (which I paid much more for), hopefully I'm not letting that affect me rating (don't think I am).

So I ordered an XL but it was way too form fitting for my liking and way too short. It's made mostly of cotton and some spandex so it will shrink so I don't dare dry it. I really would like to try an XXL in the hopes that it would be longer and not so tight. However the shirt is great quality and super soft and like that there's no tag.

Another thing, I ALWAYS take a small in HEAD's products (and I have bought a lot, about 20) and this one was way off the mark. For some reason I ordered the X-Small as well as the Small when it was on Lightning Deals, and I was glad I did, for I was swimming in the Small and the X-Small fit perfectly. So if you want it fitted, go a size down. For reference, I am 5' 6.5"" Tall, 120 Lbs., 36A, 25, 37 and the X-Small was perfect. It was light, though nothing special, so I sent it back.

Overall it was a good purchase made for a party, but after a few wears there are starting to be some holes where the seams meet, and that's without putting it through the laundry yet.

3,"I have sworn by Vibram five fingers for years now, but they are not easy on the wallet. The pricepoint on these 5 toe athletic shoes is great,  but as one should assume: they aren't the same quality as Vibrams.
Pros: bright colors and attractive design, thick sole makes it feel like there is a wee bit of arch support (not much, but notable when comparing to Vibram), comfortable for full day of wear (12 hr shift).
Cons: the sole rubber is very stiff to begin with, the extra padding in the forefoot of the sole took a few wears to feel really comfortable, and the pleather outer peices are starting to peel.
Overall they are worth the purchase if you are a lover of toe shoes, but I still love my Vibrams a little more for ground feel and flexibility.
UPDATE: I've had these for a few months and I only wear them occasionally. The pleather around the edges is gone or looks ratty, and the yellow material picks up dirt like a magnet. I tried to run in these once, and the sole hit my fit in a way that made it sore for two weeks.

My toes won't slide all the way forward, so the peep toe doesn't show much, but my heel is just barely on the edge of the shoe. I think if the shoe stretched a bit the foot would go forward. The height of the bootie is hitting both the inside and outside ankle bones at just the right place to chafe, and I've been sitting on the couch with them on for 20 minutes and one of my feet has started to go numb because my stupid feet can't handle any pressure on the balls of my feet from heels.

3,"I just received my glasses in the mail today and I have some pretty mixed feelings about them:

Pros:

-  Build Quality: These glasses are built very well! They could easily rival the quality of the more expensive designer brands that you will find in a LensCrafters or some other optometrist. The frames are light but they don't feel cheap whatsoever. The arms are tight and you don't hear any type of rattle when you're picking them up or moving them around. Also, the arms have a spring hinge

-  Design: Simple yet elegant! The rhinestones add a classy touch without being overbearing. There are no brand names tattooed on the side of the frames. The arms are plastic but they have a discreet marble design to them.

Cons:

-  Really there is just one: The placement of the rhinestones! Several of the rhinestones on my frames were glued on crooked. Now I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist with things that I purchase. However, I do make room for exceptions if Im getting something at a good price. But when you have a product that has a distinctive feature or design (such as these frames, with the rhinestones on the arm), then you need to make sure that the execution of that design is on point. Now, to be fair, the rhinestones are not ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It isn't like there were stones missing, nor does it seem like any of them would easily fall off. Still, you wouldnt want to have someone compliment your glasses, and when they move in to get a closer look they, the rhinestones are looking like a crooked smile.

So while I am quite pleased with the structural quality of the frames, and I would likely order another pair of Aloha eyewear, I am disappointed with how the stones were placed. I picked out this pair specifically for the bling factor and that has let me down. Now there is a chance that you could order the exact same pair and your stones may be placed perfectly  if so, then you have an excellent pair of frames and you got a bargain.

I suppose that's fine and solvable if you're a size 6... you can order an 8 use an insert in your small foot. But if you wear 11s like me and order 12s (to play it safe - because they are close-toed novelty shoes online) you really have nowhere to go and no way to solve the issue.
I wear a size 11M.....I ordered a 12M... I could barely get them on my feet.  So make the necessary ordering adjustments if you want them.

3,"When I say they fit somewhat small,  it's because after reading lots of reviews, I ordered 1/2 size larger than I normally wear, and that was excellent advice, length-wise. Any shorter, I couldn't have worn them. I've always had extremely average-shaped feet. However, - after wearing less than an hour, I couldn't keep them from slipping off my heels. I'll have to get some big, thick, grippy heel inserts. Color was fine, construction fine. The top of the shoe cuts into my metatarsal a little, just above my big toe (I have somewhat high arches), but that may just be because they keep slipping off of my heels. The heel height, shape, and position is  nice - if it fits your foot perfectly, you could probably wear them all day. Heel shape and position (under the center of gravity of the leg) is very good. A pretty overall shoe - toe is not too round. You just have to have exactly the right shape of foot, I guess. Still - a bargain for the price - more than worth adding whatever inserts are needed.","Good for the price. Length does run short, and heels run loose."

She likes it but isn't that happy.,Actually a cranberry red when arrived
3,"Bought this in orange for my Ichigo Kurosaki costume, which the color was perfect for. Very bright orange! The length of the hair is curled very nicely, looks pretty from the back. It's quite thin though and the hair does fall out if you're not extra careful with it. The bangs are weird... I may cut them; however, it is somewhat small on my head (and I don't have a large head at all) and the cap barely reaches my ears on the sides, so cutting the bangs could somewhat expose the sides of my head a little too much and make it even more weird. Because I am wearing this wig with a mask and the weird front is not really going to be visible, I am satisfied with it for my purposes.

3,"Arrived on time and in good condition.

Only criticism seems to be that the wallet is a bit more cramped than your usual wallet, and is only capable of holding so many cards. There's a compartment with a clear plastic display for your ID which works fine, but another compartment opposite of it has the buttons (to hold the wallet together) embedded into the compartment itself. Making it so only about 2/3 of it is usable. I reserve that for tiny pictures of family. All other slots for cards are very tight and it's difficult to fit more than one into each of the three available.

Overall an okay wallet, and definitely good novelty item if you're a Trekkie like me. I would've preferred it were bigger and the buttons latched on a more ergonomic location.","Good novelty item, but not the best."

3,"I purchased the heather oatmeal in size XL. The top is a boxy fit in the width and almost crop length. I wear a women's medium to large and this top was loose fitting in the body. The actual measurements are underarm to underarm laying flat 25"" and shoulder seam to bottom of lace 21"". The sleeve/underarm seam sits halfway down the bicep and not at the edge of the shoulder creating the loose boxy effect. With the sleeve seam sitting so low, the sleeves end up being really long and covering most of my hand. The seam does not stretch so if you have larger biceps I believe this top wouldn't fit. Even if you filled out the body more than I do, the shoulder seam would still be further down the bicep as the shoulder seam to seam is almost the same measurement as the underarm. The fabric in the body is very soft and semi-sheer and quite stretchy. I'm rating it 3 stars because it was a wearable fit for me and reasonable quality for the price.",Nice top but the larger size is looser fitting through the body than shown in picture

3,"I love the Gogh Moc Suede Fit Flop style. My first pair, (purchased a few years ago thru Amazon), was in the color 'Everglades - color combo of a neutral sand/grey.  My next pair is my favorite, but I am struggling to understand why.... I am pretty sure it's the same ""Gogh Moc suede"" style- in navy blue... yet stood out, in comfort, in looks (better suede), compared to my first pair. This review is specifically for the purchase of a 3rd pair. Again, same style (supposed to be Gogh Moc Suede- although still can't confirm), and this time, the color is a true grey. I was really hoping I would get lucky, like I did with my 2nd pair in navy blue. Unfortunately, got the worst out of the three: initial impression was not authentic Fit Flops. The symbols were where they are supposed to be so I believe they are genuine.  It's a quality issue again- the structure is not as padded with that ""Fit Flop-ergonomic"" comfort. And, the suede, is not really suede-looking (dull, rough, as opposed to a plush suede, which influences comfort (softer), and deepens the richness of color). Overall, this pair has that bare bones, minimalist feel. Not loving it. But they are still comfortable; wearing them regularly, around the house, like my blue pair. One day, I will solve this mystery..... (if there is a #4, it won't be a crap shoot).","Always Comfortable, Even when Design is Inconsistent"

I even tried it with a nude colored bra to see if my underwear was less visible (no!). You could clearly see my entire bra, my torso, and where my pants began. NOT the look I was going for. In order to wear this without feeling like a hooker, I'd have to wear a camisole under it, or a sweater over it.

The tag inside only says ""Thai Silk"" and the product description online just says ""silk fabric"", but nowhere does it say ""100%"" silk.  I wonder if there is a small amount of silk in it, but that it's mostly some other synthetic. There are no care instructions sewn into the garment but Amazon added a paper card that says it's machine wash AND tumble dry.  Even the washable silks say to hang to dry, not to tumble dry, so I'm thinking it's probably not real silk, or at least not 100%.

Update
I've gotten some negative votes on this recently and I'd like to clarify:
When I said painted I meant with a plastic like paint which unless you have very thin thighs it will peel off. I reviewed originally before wearing and I only got 2 wears out of it because the plastic-paint was peeling off the first time and the second I sat on a hot metal bench which deformed the paint slightly.",Updated review
3,"Suit is great  but major concern with having brand name in large bold print on the rear of the suit with a child (or anyone really)
I had ordered a medium and got a lg which was good as med is small  --costume fits like a unitard so it's tight--my son was able to wear his skiing compression pants/top underneath.  Tons of compliments on the costume--he wore it with basketball shorts to school to add to the ensemble.
Cons:  1) it's tight and getting the head to close it tough plus you can't really see through which made walking challenging--ended up not closing the head
2) across the rear-end it has the brand name  'Morphsuits' in Big Dark Letters--so everyone was constantly asking him what was on his rear--not appropriate to have that on a kids costume boy or girl.  Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking as my son was embarrassed when everyone was trying to read it.  Will be writing to the manufacturer as well.

You can really see where the stones were set into a pattern in the metal, not like most pave jewelry. It reminds me of one of those lattice apple pies with the criss cross tops. You have to get close to see it but *I* know it's there and that's what matters! For the most part when I wear them people just see black heart earrings that sparkle slightly.

The chain also looks cheap and of a style I would expect on a $10 necklace from a mass-market accessories store. One side of the metal bracket holding the stones also has a black spot on it, as though it was damaged by heat or something. It will not come off.

The tiny cubic zirconia stones, however, lack sparkle.  When the stones catch the light at the right angle, then they will shine, but its still a kind of a muted shine.

I ordered a small (4-6) to be on the safer ""larger"" side, and I could not get it zipped up over my torso.

3,"Positives:
I bought these shoes because they have a classic/very good looking Chelsea silhouette.  The dark brown is also unique, a great alternative to black in all situations.  The toe is also very nice, not too round and not too square.

Negatives:
The fit is not true to size.  I repeat, the shoe does not fit to size.

I can wear a 9.5 to 9, so I bought these in a size 9.  For these shoes, I would have certainly needed an 8.5, which I find quite insane.  The 9 is simply too large and if I had the opportunity to exchange them for a smaller size, I would have.  This leather also tends to crease easily around the toes, with cracking at the creases.  I list this as a negative, assuming you want the shoes to look the same way as you bought them, however if you like a distressed look, then you'll appreciate the wear.

Overall:
I would have rated this a 4 or 5 if the shoe fit true to size.  Also, the price is pretty great.",I bought these shoes because they have a classic/very good looking Chelsea silhouette
3,"Pros: Shipping was quick...made it from CA to PA in 4 days.

The downside is that they're definitely not super-high quality boots, hence the great price I got. For instance, the little ""logo panel"" on the tops came off within a month. They look fine without them, but to me it demonstrated that the boots are a little cheap. Also, the black stretch panel on the back has gotten very dirty with the wintry weather in my city, and water doesn't clean the stains away.

This bag does its job, with a few caveats: (1) It is very small, able to carry the items I mentioned but with absolutely no room left over. (2) the leather is thin, and areas that frequently contact the wearer's clothes fade after a few weeks, not to worn leather as I expected, but to white, so the leather was not dyed all the way through. (3) The inside is lined with a shiny fabric that makes noise when you take things out, so it can be distracting when you're in quiet places. (4) There is no reinforced spine along the bottom or sides, so it's very fragile and won't stand up on its own (figuratively or literally).

More concerning is that the inside lining has already started to pull apart, particularly on the right shoe insole.  And a small piece of the right heel sole chipped off this week.

They are also a little more on the stiff side.  I find with Clark's they are fairly stiff or nicely flexible; there seems to be no consistency.  While they offer decent support and padding, they never seemed to relax or stretch.

After 5 months the front pouch zipper began to detach.  This is an area that has little stress, because the compartment holds the computer mouse, mouse pad and snacks for long flights.

3,"I'm kinda in the middle lane with this watch.  For one, I'm a watch collector.  Nothing high end, but I find the nice compromise between price and quality.  But, on the other hand, this gift is for a lady friend who wants a wooden watch.  She won't get as deep into detail about it as I would.  So, I guess I'll give two sides to this review.  One as the average Joe, and one as the ""Hardcore"" collector.  Here we go.

Average Joe:

I guess we'll start with presentation.  The box it came in is pretty cool.  Very well made.  It looks like bamboo, but I'm not sure. The lid slides out, but is secured by magnets in the lid and box.  The watch comes on what looks like a wool or cotton pillow (nice touch).

The watch itself is very well crafted.  It's a gorgeous piece, really. I like all the small details on the bezel.  It doesn't rotate, but it's not like you'll be diving with this anyway (is modeled after a dive watch).  The time is pretty easy to read, and the hands have decent lume on them. The watch fits my average male sized wrist fairly comfortably, so I'm gonna have to resize it before handing it off as a present.

Collector:

This is gonna seem very harsh, but I'll make sure to give good points in there also.

Well, it's shaped like a dive watch.  It's wood.  This is asinine.  But, I understand it's just for style, so it's a moot point.  There's no water resistance rating.  Again, it's a wooden watch, but even a 30 meter rating will account for if it's safe, for say, getting caught in the rain.  You're not gonna go out of your way to get it wet, but it needs to at least be able to hold up to splashes.

The crown (adjustment knob) is too small, and the crown guards are too big.  This made setting time a pain.  The reliefs cut into the crown made it easy to pull out, though.  The harsh engagement when pulling the crown out threw me off when setting the date and time.  I thought I had the crown fully extended to set the time, and it was only halfway and was changing the date.  That brings me to the date window.  Too small, to deep, and could really use a cyclops over it.  Between not being able to see the date, and the tiny crown, it took a few minutes to set the date.

I don't like the movement.  I know it's nothing great, but this is along the lines of the $5-$10 Walmart unbranded watches.  Not sure how well it will keep time.  Could be hit or miss.  Not knocking it, as I have one of those same unbranded Walmart watches that keeps better time than a majority of my quartz watches.  Like, 2 seconds slow in 3 months good. (Amazing for a $12 watch).  The movement is quieter than my Timex I'm wearing as I write this.  Thanks to the insulating powers of wood, the watch isn't bad in a dead quiet environment.

I do like the bracelet and butterfly clasp.  It's a nice touch.  Again, the Lume is decent.  Very bright, but doesn't last long.

Conclusion:

Okay, I know this is a jumbled mess of stuff to read on a watch that I handled for about 15 minutes.  Overall, I guess I can say this, if you want a piece that's eye catching, a conversation starter, that seems more ""natural"", and shows of your love for the environment, get this watch.  If you're a collector, you already know to avoid it.",Middle of the road

3,"This is a nice necklace and the pendant looks fairly close to the photo. Most of the jewelry I have received from the Amazon collection have looked better in person than the photo. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.

I think the design is nice, but I wish the scroll work in the front was smooth like it is on the back. The scroll work on the front has raised dots all along the top of the scroll work. This jewelry technique, known as milgrain engraving, can be a wonderful design element on certain pieces. Unfortunately, in the case of this pendant, it only serves to detract from the beauty of Fleur-de-lis and the sparkle of the stones.  In person, these dots look much smaller and don't look as good as the picture shows. When I look at it, it reminds me of a photo that has been taken into a photo editing program and sharpened far too much. The fleur-de-lis and the ring of stones that encompass the pendant become lost in the very busy scroll pattern, which is a shame. I feel that this pendant would be much more successful if the scrolls were smooth with no extra texture to it. So basically, this pendant looks very busy to me and borders on gaudy.

The size of this pendant is 40mm across, which is just over 1 1/2 inches, so it's a good sized pendant, though not particularly heavy. It has a very thin, delicate chain, which seems to be mismatched for the size of the pendant, even though the pendant isn't all that heavy. As a Silversmith myself, I would have put this on a more appropriate larger sized chain. Not too much larger, but I would not have paired this up with such a dainty chain. Also, I would have put it on a longer chain. The chain is 18 inches. That's a nice size for a small dainty pendant, but larger pendants need a longer chain. I would want at least a 24-inch chain.

Another thing I am not happy with is the color of the gold plating. I have received other gold plated pieces from the amazon collection that have looked nice, but the gold plating on this piece leans more to brassy than gold.

I do have to add that the craftsmanship is very nice, as I expected from the Amazon collection, and the quality is very good. I just don't agree with some of the design choices on this one. I have decided to add a couple of photos of my own, both against the black of the box it came in as well as against the skin of my hand. Hopefully, you will be able to see what I am referring to when I say the scroll work is too busy.",Scroll work is too busy and detracts from the stones and the Fleur-de-lis design.

The wallet is very tight and hard to get cards in and out of initially. Im sure it will loosen up after a while.

The one thing I don't like is the more you load this wallet up, the more the card in the front pockets will begin to curve.

I can see this ruining the shape of your card after a while. So I wouldn't suggest sticking a credit card or something you need to swipe in the front pocket. Better off using the front pocket for a license or medical card.

Also, the more cards you have in the pockets, the harder it is to get them in and out.

3,"I bought the Black/Dark Shadow/White color in size 13 for my husband back on 7/28/15. We are coming up on having them for 15 months, so I figured Id write a review to show you how theyve held up.

These are just my husbands regular shoes. He wears them to work, the store, etc. He doesnt use them when doing any outdoor stuff. When we bought them, they were very attractive shoes and they do fit true to size. His number one complaint is that there is no arch support, and for that reason, he would not purchase these shoes again. I have included photos in my review of what the shoes look like currently  at almost 15 months later. As you can see, they look VERY worn, and the back part of the sole has detached. He started noticing this when the shoes were about a year old. He feels that theyve done well thus far, but I feel that they should have lasted much longer than they did. They look very raggedy now and should probably go in the trash soon. I did notice that the price has almost doubled since we bought them. I feel they were worth the $40 price at the time, and I am glad I did not spend $75 on these, which is what their current price is.

3,"This has a box-like fit, it's very wide and the fabric isn't very soft. It wasn't really what I was looking for but I was unsure how it would fit in the first place and it does look like it does in the photo, excepting the arms are shorter on me and it tends to bunch in areas. I probably wouldn't get it again but the fit might be what some people are looking for.","It's okay, but not my fit"

At first I didn't think it was the necklace and try to troubleshoot the problem, all the while wearing the necklace. I got this product because it was the style of chain I wanted and in a color I liked at a price I could handle. I continued to troubleshoot until it seemed it was the necklace because rash got worse until I have removed it. I was not sure what would cause this so I did an internet search what ""black plating"" meant; it appears it is a nickel plating process and that a LOT of people on the planet are allergic to nickel.
I think it should be noted that this product has the alloy nickel in it and that this is a potential allergy in most humans.",Contains the alloy NICKEL which can cause ALLERGIC REACTIONS!!!

3,"I really wanted to love this tank but I just don't. It's ok, which at almost $50 for a tank top doesn't merit more than 3 stars. The fabric does feel like it will hold up well but it's not super comfortable...it feels like it will hold up, kind of thick and slightly coarse. The mechanism for nursing is just like any other nursing tank, you unclip and pull it down. The mechanism for pumping is what could use some work. You lift a flap and then pull another one from the side over to the middle. Since the fabric is fairly thick it is not super comfortable. It does hold the flanges in place but I have a harder time centering them over my nipples than I do with my simple wishes hands free pumping bra. It takes one more step to put on the simple wishes pumping bra but probably less time and it's more comfortable. Plus the pumping bra can be reused several days in a row as its only worn for a few minutes at a time...and it's cheaper. So, I'll still wear this tank occasionally but it's not the first thing I'll reach for.",It's ok but for $50 I want great
3,"As other reviews state, the material is extremely comfortable even thought the sizing is somewhat small.  I normally wear a large in a t-shirt, but went up to an XL based on other reviews...the XL fits perfect.  Also, the shirt I received is not exactly what the picture looks like.  In the picture the shirt looks like a dark grey or faded black with a medium sized, faded graphic.  However, the shirt I received is a solid black one  with a large bright white graphic that is similar to other shirts.  If it was not a hassle and more money on my part...I would have returned the shirt or asked for the one pictured.

I put many miles on each pair and they look as good as the day I bought them. The shell/ body of the sneaker are well made, but the downfall is that for the miles I power walk that I do, the sole of the sneakers wear down after 8/9 months. When it's time to trash the sneaker, they still look good as when you bought them. I'm still looking for sneakers that have tough soles that can handle MANY miles, recommendations would be appreciated. As to wear for normal walk and activity, these are great  and look good.",Great Fit...
3,"Good quality, but a few problems: I ordered two belts, one black and one brown. They came in a plastic bag mailer. One of them was scuffed up, like it had been dragged on the pavement. The shipping bag was not scuffed, so the belt was scuffed prior to shipping. Fortunately I have leather dye, so I touched it up, and the scuff marks will blend in with time. Im not going to send it back, so just saying.
Next problem: I wear a size 34, but lately Ive gained a few pounds, so I went a size up. The length of my old belt is 40 inches, so I ordered the next size up; 44 inches. I also measured my waist to confirm size. I ordered a 44 inch belt, and what I got was a size 44, which measured 51 inches! I had to cut 7 inches off the belt, and punch new holes! Good thing I have leather scissors and a leather punch, and leather dye to touch up the cuts.
So I have two funny belts with a bunch of useless holes, and a less than factory finish on the ends. I somehow thought that the length of the belt was the size. Seems I was wrong.

Ran in frigid cold, through water and also mud with great results. My one complaint would be durability. I only used this shoes for trail runs, which I don't do more than once or twice a month. After less than 24 uses I noticed the webbing on the tops of the shoes are becoming separated from a the sides/bottoms. Tread still look like almost new but shoes are falling apart.",Nice feel but durability lacking.

3,I bought these about a year ago and they were great.  They were great at least until the lens broke from the frame.  They do feel kind of flimsy but you have to remember that they are made from carbon fiber.  Here in lies the problem the screws on mine ripped out of the carbon fiber frame.

3,"The treads on these shoes are weirder than I thought they would be. Remember those old aididas slip on shoes that had the weird rubber pegs on the inside that dug into your feet? That's what the treads on these shoes are like, except the rubber pegs are more spread out and only cover part of the bottom (they're missing from the arch portion of the shoe sole. It feels kind of weird to walk on them, like the rubber is flexing a little bit so I'm sliding around. The treads also come up the heel of the shoe. You can kind of see it in the picture listed with the product. I have a better picture of how it looks below.

The sued is clearly synthetic, which I expected. It doesn't look fake unless you look close and feel it. The color is true to what is pictures. I actually like the color a lot.

The shoes seem like they will work with what I bought them for--loafers I can slip on when I need to run somewhere quick. Definitely not as good as my old minetokan moccassins that I got these to replace, but they're way cheaper so what can I expect?

Granted, I wear it a lot, but I'll need to give it up soon if the wear continues. It's a shame - I would have paid more for a charm that is also sterling. The design and execution are really nice.

The fit would be perfect if it had a bit more fabric in the cups, but they end way too soon and leave everything loose.

3,"My beloved Clark's Ash boots are finally starting to show their wear. No holes or anything, just lack of tread etc.

So, I bought these, since the Ash were the best boots I've owned, and I'm almost exclusively a boot wearer.

They are the usual lightweight, waterproof boots you'd expect from Clarks, but they look a little tacky. Instead of a solid, shaped body and toe, it's a got double stitched layers.

What is really causing me issues is the hardened heel guard only goes halfway up the boot, so you end up one of those classic boot design failures - the gap between the soft and hard part of the guard rubs against your heel and causes blisters.

This could be due to my left foot being _slightly_ smaller than my right, but in 1 mile of walking I've developed a blister already. Some boots simply don't extend that guard high enough and cause this problem - the Ash style's guard goes all the way up, for instance.

My right foot doesn't have a blister yet, but I can definitely feel the guard rubbing there too.

Bear in mind that everyones feet are different and you might have a different experience - with shoes, it's best to actually go try them on in person. I just hoped I could get away with an online order","Okay, with blisters :("

3,"Yes they do look good, but as people say the smell is like I've never experienced.  When walking into the Post Office to pick these up the entire building smelled a bit off.  Yep, it was these shoes.  Permeated through the box and shipping bag.  The smell filled my vehicle on the way home.  I had to immediately get rid of the packing material and put the shoes outside.  I recommend keeping them outside for a week or two to air them out.  Even then the smell isn't completely gone.  You may have to plan to store them outside indefinitely.  To me, it's what I imagine a tire factory smells like.  Not just tire smell, but all the toxic waste by-product smell I imagine a factory has.  Maybe some kind of dangerous VOC's coming off these things?  Can't be good for you.  But they are inexpensive and look good.  I got the brown in a size 12 and they fit like my other size 12 shoes.","Inexpensive, look good, terrible smell."

I asked to do an exchange and they told me to just keep it and give it to a friend, which I did (I believe that it came from overseas and wouldn't be worth the shipping).  I reordered the coat again in BLUE in the same size again and this time they sent blue but it didn't fit when the grey one fit perfectly. There was a big size difference, I hadn't gain any weight or anything but I couldn't get it all the way on my arms.

I love the material, stitching and the trim with the cool zippers that go halfway up the back of the sleeve.  The blue is a very nice navy color and I wish that I had gotten a chance to wear it but I also had to give it away.  The reason that I'm giving an average star rating is because the company obviously has excellent service and tried to make me happy- the free coat was an great CS move, I thought.

3,"I am a little disappointed with this pair of Propet after I had an excellent pair of different model in the same brand.  My wife is also a big Propet fan and owns at least five pairs of them happily.  My last pair of Propet sandals had a wide base  and provide great support for my feet.  This pair is much narrower, although I ordered it in 3E width, and my feet are only slightly wider than an M, the bottom of my feet already filled the sole edge to edge.  The position of the front strap's velcro was not sown on quite right.  Once folded over tightly around the front of my foot, the top velcro would almost passed the entire bottom valcro that supposedly holding it in place.  Granted a (much) wider foot would make the folded over part shorter to provide a more secure hold with the bottom, but a wider foot would be hanging over the edge of the shoes!  Also, the straps are quite narrow, giving the impression of flimsiness.  I did not return this pair because I have just returned another pair of 3E Propet boots to Amazon the day before due to their narrowness, and felt a little bad on kept on returning shoes although Amazon was outstanding in returning merchandise.  At the time,  I also need a pair of sandals for specific purpose, so I kept it and tolerated the borderline usefulness of these sandals.

3,"Overall this is a good, solid, and well constructed bag.  It's roomy and can hold a large amount of files an books. Among the pluses is the large center main pocket absent a divider.  Also there are 9 exterior pockets that should satisfy any hyper-organized person. For those who like to carry their briefcase on their shoulder, the strap is adequate for this purpose.  However, the bag holds so much that carrying it this way will weigh a person down! The double handles are the way to go. They are strong and sturdy.  The third handle on the main pocket is redundant and generally pointless. Why it was even added seems a mystery. Despite it's positives this particular model does have two substantial flaws which depresses the overall rating.  One is the quality of the leather.  It's OK but not of the high caliber that a bag of this nature should have. The leather is prone to wear and crinkling even after a few weeks.  That's fine if you want a broken-in look in a hurry rather than a few years. But it's not fine if you are looking for a classy professional briefcase as I was. Also the leather scratches easily--too easily in fact. If I could buy this bag over again, I'd purchase the model with the distressed leather which can easily be cleaned and restored with the same leather care products used on distressed leather boots.",A Good Bag with Some Flaws

3,"Previous reviews range from may damage cabinets when removed, to no problem if you remove them.  I have new cabinets, did not realize these could only be glued on.  I thought latching them onto bathroom cabinet door knobs was possible. My mistake. I also have a stainless steel side by side refrigerator.  In the photo, it showed the latch on a standard door refrigerator.

These latches should be fine on older cabinets, or cabinet areas that are not exposed to much viewing, like the dangerous bathroom cabinets that may contain many chemicals, and may not be showplace cabinets.  I decided not to risk defacing new cabinets with glued on latches.  I will remove all harmful substances from the lower cabinets. Certainly, all of us would opt to pay for a kitchen remodel rather than have a baby/toddler ingest harmful substances.

I may be way off but there may be a pricing mistake here.  I googled the item and every single seller, and I'm talking major sellers like BBB, have this as $ 5.99 for the 2 pack. Of course having the convenience of free shipping and not driving around is valuable.  Please comment if I'm wrong and I will delete this sentence.  I also noticed that there appear to be no verified buyers on this item.  Meaning, reviewers received the items free.  Even at BBB, the reviewer stated they received the item free from a major baby store seller.  That's not a problem as a manufacturer needs reviews to  educate buyers on the value of a product.  That's what Vine is for.  When I buy fromAmazon, I look for verified buyers, although I consider Vine Reviewers to be well informed and to give honest reviews.

I put a lot of thought into this review.  I'm not critical of the product, in giving it 3 stars.  For factors important to me, it's worth 3 stars. For others, I'm sure it is worth 5 stars.",Are your cabinets showroom new or well worn?

3,"Cute, flashy but not trashy and tight on my wrist. No extra links come with the watch. Have purchased other ""bracelet"" or ""boyfriend"" type watches and they are usually slightly loose. Have had to remove links. This one must be made with very thin wristed watch-wearers in mind.

Had to go to watch repair shop. They have to order links from Movado representative. Will take minimum 2 weeks to get links and then time to add. First 2 links are free through company though.

So, bottom line is if you don't have a tiny wrist, don't plan on wearing right out of the box :(",Excited and deflated...ugh
3,"I ordered the same pants in grey on another website and the fit is drastically different between the two.  The grey pair from the other site are a real medium, if not a little roomy for a medium, like the lounge type pants another reviewer mentioned.  The black medium pair I received in my Amazon order are really like a small, and very fitted in the rear end area.  I can still wear them but it's not the fit I was looking for.  I'm thinking these are a Junior's medium, not a women's size as the description states.","Small fit, probably Junior's or Asian sizing"

Tight, stretchy, and light weight.
 I was disappointed in the amount of ""Glow in the Dark"". I figure when the description stated glow in the dark features, the entire jacket didn't glow. But was surprised the glow is the dark features were limited to the plastic zipper cover, a small strip on each arm, and a strip running down the back.
Since the headline was ""Glow in the Dark""
I just thought it'd be more...

3,"Looks good except for its poor design.  The clasp that holds this pre-tied tie in place is right in front, next to the tied material of the bow.

3,"I bought this bag to replace my old favorite one, which I had used so much for so long that it had huge holes in it and I finally had to toss it.  When I first opened this bag, I noticed they were the same brand!

This is a cute bag which has held up okay.  The stitching on the front pocket split open, causing some coins to fall out (and had I had anything more valuable than 75 cents, this would have been a big issue).  There wasn't anything particularly heavy or bulky in that pocket, just a few coins, so Im not sure what prompted it to rip other than poor stitching.

The bag is really cute, but the colors have gotten a little dingy.  You can really tell that I use this purse every day.  It is made of a canvas-type material, which attracts a lot of stains from my jeans and just dirt in general.  It has also pulled a lot in the back, where it rubs against my jeans/pants.

The strap is a great length, I was looking for a cross-body purse and this is perfect because you can adjust it.  However, the leather on the underside of the strap (where it rests against my shoulder) has started to fade.

Overall it is a cute purse, but I wouldnt buy it for everyday use, and I wouldnt store anything valuable or small in it.","Cute purse for the money, but shows signs of wear"

3,"I ordered the Mens sized 13  Yes/ No Spinner Ring by KONOV Jewelry. It arrived in a small bubble mailer -the packing slip/ receipt is a sticker stuck to one side that basically tells anyone who handles it basically  what the content is! Strange, I guess thats the way it's done in China. On to the ring, it's pretty much your basic spinner ring, on the outer ring are a series of  YES and NO  encircling it. Note: the words are not actually cut INTO the metal where you can feel them if you run your finger over them. It's almost as if they're  printed on the metal. I'm not sure if repeated spinning of the ring will erode the script in time. The lettering is nicely done although a bit difficult to see in low light or at a distance. The ring as a whole is well constructed-no burrs or rough edges. The spinning action on my ring spun but with a lot of drag, it  slightly  resisted  attempts to freely spin, after about an hour with it the spin on is a little better but still not freely . There's some slight play between the two ring . I hope that's normal.

As stated earlier it was shipped in a mailer , inside was a protective plastic bag along with the small  (ring sized) KONOV Jewelry velvet bag and a double sided sheet displaying other KONOV items. The size was almost perfect -a 12 would've fit my ring finger tighter, but 13 is only a little  bit loose. The metal has a nice luster to it and polishes up easily. Overall for the price it's a great bargain and an attractive piece of jewelry to own . It looks great on my hand -narrow and not bulky at all. . I took away 2 stars because 1) I felt the spinning action should've been smoother and 2) the ""engraving was not that great.

Im a pretty solid 8.5 W or 9 C, but got the 9W because the last pair ran just a tad short. The 9W is much better.

I got two of them as gifts for my tween daughter and teen niece who are steampunk / Dr. Who fans.  They look pretty good, work well, and have a nice size and weight for a pocket watch to be worn by a woman, maybe a bit small for a man.  The chain also a nice weight, but is a bit too shiny.

3,"I would actually give these 1 star out of the box, and 4-5 stars when I was done with them! These are exactly what I have been looking for and the price was very reasonable. So I was very unhappy when I tried them on and they were one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have ever tried on. They are stiff, the sides and back come up very high and cut into my ankles - I could barely walk to the mirror to look at them! But I absolutely loved they way they look, so I tried putting in gel heel pads AND cushion insoles, and now they seem pretty comfortable. I wear a size 7 - once I put in the pads and insoles, the 7 fits comfortably and does not slip off my feet. So I would recommend these if you are willing to do a little work on them.",Need Some Work to Fit

The sequence catches easily and falls off if untangled with out caution. The sizing is off. I bought a size 8 and it was more like a size 2/4. I think the sizing may change dress to dress (hand cut issue).

I normally wear a women's small/medium, but to be safe, I ordered this shirt in an XXL. The shirt is a bit large on me, but it's not even close to drowning me like an XXL normally would, and it's not anything that can't be fixed with a trip to the dryer.

(And for any Matt Cosplayers looking into getting this shirt - it definitely works. Just be careful with sizing. You might have to cut the neck a bit, because the shirt doesn't have the same neckline as Matt's, but it's nothing that isn't an easy fix.)",Order a bigger size!

3,"This watch was purchased for my 11 year old granddaughter, but it is definitely not a child's watch; it's even big for an adult woman.

The display is very difficult to read unless the light button is pushed. If the light button is pushed and released, the display stays lit for only two seconds.  If you hold the light button down the light stays on, but cycles through a rainbow of colors.

The watch is quite heavy; definitely too heavy for a child, and probably too heavy for most women.  The widest part of the watch face, including case, is close to two inches.  This watch is bigger and heavier than a lot of men's watches; I definitely would not recommend it for a young person, or even most women.

3,"Loads of pockets as advertised, but many of them are ""pockets-in-pockets"" as defined by a small zipper or velcro patch and, as such, are hardly useable.  The RFID block pouch is a nice idea, but it's hard to get at given the overly-aggressive velcro used.  This is one of the few travel vests with a RFID blocking pocket, but it's also twice the price of many other travel vests.  And given that you can get a wallet or travel case with RFID blocking capability easily for $10 to $20, it doesn't make sense that this vest should cost so much more.  Finally, the zippers.  Many customers have already noted difficulty with the zippers and while the zippers on my vest seemed to work well for the first week or so, they're already starting to get stuck and be quite finicky.  I don't know why the manufacturer would let a detail like this go unresolved.  The zippers are going to be the most-used part of the vest; they should be bullet-proof and operate flawlessly, not leave you wondering if the zipper is going to work next time.

So while I've only been wearing/using this vest for a few weeks now, my initial impression is luke-warm at best; kind of a ""take it or leave it"" attitude towards the vest so far.  At this price point ($135USD), the cost of the vest is not outrageous, but I am hesitant to call it a good value (especially as I may have to replace the zippers).

If my impression of the vest changes over time, for better or worse, I shall update this review.","Finicky, Fiddlly, and a bit Expensive (for the performance)"

3,"Makes me look old and dowdy and wider than I actually am! I am a size 8-10 normally closer to a 10 in women's clothes and a size M-L top, medium most of the time. The print is cute with the polka dots but I don't like how the black sown in jacket falls. The arms are a bit tighter for me, however, there is plenty of give and stretch. The major problem is this is just not a flattering cut for me. It would be great as separates actually, with a polka dot shell and just a black sweater instead of the polyester sown in jacket. This is the first time buying a twofer or a duet top for me, might be my last at this rate. I have to find something more youthful if I happen to buy a duet or twofer again, most likely something in the Juniors department. This is just so NOT me in styling. Pros: It is cheap and comes with a necklace that you can use with something else and it looks better without the necklace. If you are younger and want to look older and if you are very skinny this will give your body some volume and make it look like you have curves. Good for office if you are cold and very ""easy wear"" meaning you don't think about coordination at all, just put this on and a skirt or pants and you are good to go into work.
Cons: Don't like the ALL POLY fabric, sown in jacket is not flattering the way it falls on the body, sleeves are a bit tight on me, I'm a big fan of black and white but just don't like the way this looks on me. Makes you look older if you are in your late 30's!","Just OK, but I'm sure this will work for others, just not my style"

These fit more like an 8- a little loose but not enough to try 1/2 size smaller
On the positive, the toe box is roomy...no pinches at all.

The style is different-for sure: but I guess that I am not as different as this style...
they definitely have a bowling shoe vibe...or at best; a fashion sneaker look...but definitely not a sneaker comfort level.
Very thin barren soles, although my feet are sensitive. I tend to pound the pavement a lot and these wouldn't be able to withstand the abuse :~ ) so for all the sporty vibe, they really are not too sporty.
Actually, they seem kind of fragile,

So I bought these as a replacement for those and after 9 months, the soles are cracked, and I've had to have the seams around the toe crease repaired.

for a photo shoot and thats about it for me. The fit is a bit off compared to the other corsets I have purchased
on Amazon, but its not bad for a short term use outfit or prop. I bought a size up in a Medium even though my
measurments said a Small was my correct fit. Im glad I went with the medium as the Small may have been a
bit to tight though probably manageable. This is in no way a waist training corset and is for fun/costume use.

The bow is very cute and elegant on the side, the cut of the shoe at the vamp is unique and very flattering on the foot and I find that the height of the shoe at the ankle, gives this shoe a little bit of an edge and not too girly.

The only comment, the Pewter colour is not exact in the picture.  It is darker and has a slight bronze/taupe colour to it.  The shoe, I found, ran a little small due to style, so I would go half a size up for ease of getting into the shoe.

3,"I would rank them a five star, except for the durability of the sole. I purchased in 2017-02. As of 2018-07 the laces are out lasting the soles. They are woren to the point that I slip on wet concrete.

I love the look. Comfort is incomparable to any other zero lift shoe that I have owned. I wear these at least five days a week. I like that the Merrell has a thicker sole than the Vivobarefoot Oxford. I do not feel pebbles in the Merrell, but the durability in a $100 should last more than  18 months.

However for the price and if I did really like this style  they are great nonetheless. I never really liked very tight jeans either. So I believe they could be rated higher I gave them a neutral because I like true quality and this is not it but it is a successful fake and a good deal if this is your style.

I'll have to see how these do after a few wearings.  Three stars because they are comfortable and no obvious other defects, and for an economical price.

Comfortable enough, but they have zero arch support. They are warm enough if you don't plan to walk around in them much. I'm already looking to replace them.

I contacted Reactor's customer service and sent in a requested phone illustrating the issue. There response was that although the MOM was set a little low that it appeared to be normal and that this watch would pass their QC testing. After failing to resolve this issue with Reactor's customer service department and to try to have it fixed under warranty, I will arrange with Amazon this week to send the watch back for either a refund of in exchange for something else.

The pictures here do not do them justice. The design is so intricate. They look incredible when they're in your ears, too. I get loads of compliments on them. HOWEVER, I want to cry every time I put them in or take them out. The widest part is just too wide and very sharp. I have literally cut my ear lobes on them. I only take them out when I'm in the shower now because the hot water helps. I don't know what to say, if you can put up with the pain of getting them on/off then these are totally worth it. I am just now thinking that the back could be sanded down some, so maybe one of you handy fools out there could do that. Then they'd be perfect.","Beautiful, but painful"

3,"It would have been 5 stars for the interior alone. Its beautiful inside and has many compartments that hold a lot. However that's where it ends. The wheels are horrible,  and after 3 months they are squeaking noisily as I walk through the airport.  The bag does not roll straight,  especially when held on left side (no idea why this should be different than the right). The bag rolls sideways instead of straight.  I'm constantly fighting with it to roll correctly.  The handle also collapses easily if you don't grip it exactly right. Even with the beautiful inside,  I hate this bag and I'm ready to toss it and look for another.  I travel every week so the last thing I want is to struggle with a laptop bag.",Horrible wheels

3,"I liked the design of this watch, and got it to see how good (or bad) a $20 watch actually is. I have to say this watch has the potential to be a winner, but is not quite there yet. Foremost, the design is very nice, with the ""wavy"" design of the inner face reminiscent of the light-capturing design of some Citizen Eco-drives. The watch itself appears to be sturdy and has significant ""heft"" to it. Size information is accurate, it has a diameter of about 45 mm. So far it keeps time accurately. The watch band is nice enough, but is a bit light-weight. The biggest con is that the 3 small dials (and the two push buttons at 2 and 5 o'clock) are decorative only; i.e. they don't move and have no function.
My suggestion to Weide: 1) add some functionality to the small dials and the push buttons (chronometer, date functions etc) and 2) use a watchband with a bit more weight. With these improvements, Weide could charge $15 or $20 more for this watch and would have a real winner - and the watch would still be very affordable!",Suggestions to Weide to make this a winner

3,Sizing is off. I have a narrow foot but the shoe was still extremely tight.,Runs small
3,"Cons: It doesn't look much like the picture. The silver zippers are so big they hang down enough to touch the buckles on the side. There is no space to tuck in the ""movable"" part of the zipper. They are also that super shiny silver that looks cheap. The inside lining is baby pink, not red. The arms are very small. I have thin arms, and it was a struggle to get my arm in the jacket. The lining goes all the way down the sleeves and is very bunchy. I am normally a size small to medium, but I got a large in case the jacket ran small. It still won't zip over my chest. If you are bigger than a B cup, this is not the jacket for you. There are also several snags in the lining where the zipper caught it during shipping.
Pros. The quilting detail is nice. The sleeves are long and the jacket fits along my shoulders like it should. I gave this 3 stars because it is mostly well made and the price. If this jacket had cost any more, I would have given it 2 stars.",Not like the pictures

The pink stitching is a nice accent. The leopard print is very small and looks a little strange and dull, not very defined. This is likely because of the flannel fabric.",not bad
3,"The product and the quality is ok, unfortunately it is not the ""official"" merchandise, as the print on the back is missing. So it's more or less a look-a-like. Got the same T-shirt as an original merchandise from years back, the quality of the shirt was better (thicker) and the print on the back is also there. Ordered it from Old Glory due to the available size. As it was delivered to Germany, a return is way to expensive, so i'll keep it, but I am still a little bit disappointed. See the picture I add with the official merchandise.","Ok, but not maybe it's not an official merchandise"

3,"The gloves & wand are great. My only complaint about the gloves is that they are a true blue, like Cinderella's color of blue, rather than a more turquoise hue of Elsa's dress. The gloves & crown/wand do not match. This does not bother my 4 yo so it's not too big of a deal for us. The crown is quite flimsy and cheap.","Crown quality poor, gloves wrong color but otherwise great"

The other reviews also said the same and I should have listened.  I believe it is made in China and the fit models there are much more petite than Americans....for the most part.  If you are more petite, this would be a nice dress for the fall because of the heaviness of the material.  Definitely not a summer dress.

The width is basically fine but the right foot is weirdly  hitting on the toe I think because the leather is a bit dryer and because lining is rough, Socks will have to be worn and leather oiled to allow a bit of a change in shape of that foot bed. Having said all that, the boot is cute. I have purchased Anthem and Blue Bird by Dan Post other places, and they did not have these problems.",Cute boots but a bit dissapointed

Busts are more likely to grow in pregnancy, so I wish they had this with the seam just a little bit lower! It still worked when my bump was a little smaller but as I've grown it just kinda looks like a shapeless sack now. I'll probably be able to wear it after my pregnancy so it's not a complete loss. If you're busty or curvy I recommend Momo Maternity for tops and dresses. They are so cute and flattering for curvier figures in pregnancy.",Too small in the bust for pregnancy

Made it through a wash with no issues. I tried it on, ordered a Medium, again this other listing that I probably should have bought from; all the girls ordered a size higher or it was too tight across the chest. I am not busty, these girls must be. It's comfortable but a bit big, and in my opinion a tad short. To put into perspective I'm 5'6"" and 140, I usually wear a small. The color was true to whats depicted though, that was nice, it matches the con's I bought to go with it.",Why no socks...

3,Many reviewers noted that this sweater is smaller than they expected. Yep. I'm a 44 short in a sport jacket and usually wear a size large. The body on this work well if it was a shirt but it's pretty tight for something you wear over other clothes. And the sleeves are very thin. I'm not a huge weight lifter or anything but these sweaters sleeves are for twig armed guys. It is light weight but that's what I wanted as it's for my office which is kept at about 65 degrees. I'll keep it but I do wish it was bigger and probably should have listened to all those reviewers who noted that is ran small.,It is a little too small - order one size larger than you normally would.

Really sad because I love the color- the shark shade is like gray-meets-mauve. It looks just as nice in person. Im sure theyd be fine under a long tunic or dress, but I was hoping to wear them with tops that might ride up and show some booty area accidentally, and I cant take that risk with these.

Another tag, as can be seen in the attached picture, says it is size 46 ( which means it is much larger than size 11). So, it is very hard to say what sized shoe I was sent & the shoe is very big for me (especially the length).

Even though the quality seems subpar with non-existent arch support, it looks good and I mainly bought it to keep my feet cool in the summer. Unfortunately, I am returning it and I don't know if I will be sent the correct size if I reorder it one size down.","Decent shoe, wrong size"

The materials look very low grade. I only wore the shoe for a few hours and actually went for a drive and go karting and the outside of the ball of the foot has a scuff mark which. The shoe felt alright but I don't think these will last long.

The stitching is poor, including the Mercedes Benz star arrow which isn't lined up...The left shoe is a tad heavier... "" not that it matters"" but yes I tend to exam things carefully as I can if I'm spending a large amount of money.  Some people spend over a 100 dollars on a 25 dollar shoe... Well, it better be up to specifications......

I love the colors and the design but the materials and build are D grade quality. The leather die color peeling off, have me feeling some type of way.
Over all, its a nice shoe.. just  feel quality isn't there. Maybe it's because I  see a Mercedes arrow and I see perfection LOL. They do have the two best drivers LOL

I was hoping to be able to wear these with a semi-dressy/semi-casual outfit, but they are more just a muck boot sort of look (AKA I can't really get away with wearing these to church).

The quality of them seems fine, and consistent with other Hue products. I expected them to be thicker, since I have a couple other pairs of cable knee socks from Hue that are a thick, chunky knit.

They hug your foot and leg in a supportive way.  While I am happy with my purchase, there are two things I was a little disappointed about: (1) I am a size 6 and purchased a size 6.  They fit nicely everywhere except around the heel.  They are rather large in that area and the boot still feels loose in the heel even when wearing a heavy sock; (2) the 2nd time I wore these boots we had a heavy dew on the grass.  When walking through the grass the heavy dew seeped into the boot and my sock got wet.  I was surprised by this as Clarks has such a good reputation.  I wasn't walking through water puddles, just briefly through wet grass.  For these reasons only, I am giving it 3 stars.",A nice boot but a little large in the heel

The outer part of the upper brown strap appears to be leather, but the lining is not, and neither is the front (white) strap. That meant that besides being hot, unbreathable, and slippery in humid weather, they had no give at all, and the upper strap strangled my high-instep feet. I sent them back. On the plus side, though, the arch was wonderfully supportive and the sole was extremely comfortable. And they're certainly pretty shoes.

I bought a size LARGE in the other shirt (because it was the biggest size available) and it fit me better than the size XL in this shirt.

3,"I ordered a large. I am 5'4"" 145 lb and usually wear a misses 12 top/8 bottom. The sleeves on this sweater are snug but wearable over a tank which is okay in Texas . I do not think they would work over a long sleeved top unless it was very form fitting also. The acrylic knit is thin but washes and drapes well on me. The collar behind the neck folds down but not enough to cover the unfinished seams so unless your hair covers it that seems like a design flaw. The sweater fits close across the shoulders and back. The knit is see-through, revealing more ""back fat"" contours than I would prefer. The bottom flairs which can be seen in the sample photo of the back of the sweater. Someone else wrote that it was made for a person with hips and I agree it would work well on a person with a pear shape (very small top and arms with ample hips). The flair seems funny to me too.

Despite how solid and substantial the watch looks, it is only rated to 3 ATM, not sufficient for showering.  This is a major disappointment for me.  I don' t like to take my watch off.

As for the frequency thing, as a scientifically trained person, this is just mumbo jumbo.  Frequency is the rate at which something occurs. SCientifically, it is rate of vibration. How does it ""harness"" frequency?  And frequency of what?  They imply electromagnetic waves on the website.... but how does one harness that?  The website says something about lightning and quotes great scientists.. But mentioning and quoting great scientists with great drawings and sketches doesn't mean there is science there. I could go into more detail but... well... lets be honest.  It is rubbish.  Placebo is a powerful thing so maybe there is something there in that sense.  There is a second band you are supposed to wear at night to harness the frequencies...  I just can't comment further on that.....

Instructions are generic, covering all their watches.  Boxes are like high end watches.

Bottom line, gorgeous, substantial looking but expensive watch.  Not waterproof for showering based on the 3 ATM rating.","Gorgeous but expensive watch, not waterproof for showering.  Science part is fantasy."

The price on amazon between the large medium has drastically changed, so I'm going to just try carefully shrinking it a bit. The pockets are nor especially well thought out. The colors don't look so good together, which is why in some pictures the lighting is darker. I sure thought it looked good in the store, but in person its just much to beige/cream in color.

These shoes have performed admirably since I purchased them last year.  The fit is wonderful and no blisters.  The grip is fantastic, too.  I took these across knife edge to Katahdin, the Subway route in King Ravine, the North Tripyramid slide, and they went with me on a Presidential Range (19 miles and 9K elevation gain) and Zealand-Bonds traverses (20 + miles with 4K+ elevation gain).  I really felt I hiked faster in them, the laces were great - I never have to worry about them coming untied.  The waterproof GTX version was a godsend with the wet weather we get here in New Hampshire...

However, today, for the first time since last year I put these babies back on my feet and halfway through a 12 mile hike, I stepped into a mud puddle and my foot felt wet.  I looked down and found the stitching had come apart and there was a hole in the side of my shoe.  I do hike a lot, but my other Salewas lasted me a couple seasons.  Because I don't hike with these in the winter, I only got a 3/4 of a season out of some pricey shoes.

3,"Great deal for the price, but not quite what I was expecting.

This is NOT a chronograph. The tachymeter and the chronograph-like buttons are deceptive. The top button adjusts the day of the week and the bottom button adjusts the date of the month. You really only should ever need to use the bottom button, which is convenient, but you are not supposed to adjust these arms between 9pm and 4am or they ""...may not move correctly.""

The color is more ""girly"" than I expected, which is fine, it looks very nice, but it's not quite my style. The calendar arms for date of the month are just slightly off once it gets to 10 and above. This can make it a bit tricky to tell exactly where the arm is pointing, but you can read it at a glance once you're used to it.

The tachymeter on the bezel is useless without stopping the watch with the second hand at exactly twelve. If the bezel rotated, you could still use it without interfering with time keeping, but it does not. It is a pointless decoration. I'd rather have minute markers on the bezel on this kind of watch.

Overall, if you want a nice watch with a basic calendar, for a good price, you can't go wrong with this one. I did have to remove two links to get it to fit, which I prefer to the band being too short of course. It's also a little uncomfortable, but it's hard to pinpoint why.

Whatever you wear under it, it will be seen. I can see my black bra through this shirt so I just wear a bandeau (which you can still see) to make it stylish. I ordered coral and the color is very bright and rich and more towards pink than straight coral (usually pinkish-orange).

Overall, this shirt can be styled nicely when put together right due to its simplicity and design. Its very comfortable and made well. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my own honest opinion.","Cute & comfy, slightly see through"

3,"I think the dress is pretty sexy, and my boyfriend agrees!

Unfortunately I haven't worn it out yet though. The way the back is cut makes it fall very, very low on my short torso, and it constantly wants to ride up, causing the shoulders to slip. I also can't wear a bra without it being completely visible. I tried wearing a turtleneck underneath, but the material is very thin (though it feels nice on the skin) so it looked very lumpy. Since this is ""juniors"" I sized up one, but I could definitely have fit the smaller size and it may have helped the slipping problems.

Love that it's GOTS certified organic cotton, but after washing this the first time it shrunk and fit our baby right out of the hospital but he quickly outgrew it. My son was 7lbs, 9oz, 20 inches at birth, so not a gigantic baby and it probably lasted at most a month, but of course we didn't get much use out of it as we don't do laundry every day. Definitely doesn't seem like 0-3 months, more like newborn. It is cute and nice, neutral colors if you don't like anything too girly or boyish. They held up very well in the wash, besides the shrinking. No fraying, or warping. Buttons stayed nice and lined up and still looks new. Would have liked to have the option to buy a larger size.

It does run a little small, so consider getting a size up. And important to know - the flower is actually a pin. Annoying because you're likely to forget to remove it before you wash the dress. If you do remove it, chances are high you'll lose it. And while the dress is being worn by a toddler, there's always the fear that it will be pulled on/played with, ruining the dress.
