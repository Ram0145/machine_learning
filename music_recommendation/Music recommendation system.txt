Dataset:

1. Dataset is from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset
2. This file conatins 4 columns. 
3. Removed link column. 

Model_Training.py
1. The dataset from kaggle is loaded here. As per system capacity, I used only 5000 rows.
2. Cleaning and stemming is been perfomed on this dataset. 
3. TFIDF vectoriser has been used to convert the words into vectors. 
4. Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity. 
5. Model is saved as a pickle file. And used in next step. 

App.py

1. We need to import the required libraries like streamlit, spotipy and impoort the already created pickle file.
2. We are using Spotify developer account to develop this project. For this, we need to signup to spotify and create a developer account. 
3. From this developer account, we need to get the client id and secret and paste it in this code
4. To access Spotify web API, we use SpotifyClientCredentials class and give our id and password. This will connect us to spotify web.
5. Model is based on cosine similarity. The generated similairy distance will be used here to recommend.
